 Ahmedabad 13 June 2019:  Adani Australia on Thursday received its final environmental approval needed to begin work on its Carmichael mine in Central Queensland.   
  

 
Speaking on the occasion  Mr. Gautam Adani, Adani Group Chairman,  said, “Today our remarkable journey of conviction, resilience, and commitment in Australia enters a new phase. I am thankful to the Queensland government and the Australian federal government for believing in the Adani Group's vision of strengthening India's energy security and creating new opportunities for the people of Australia.” 
  

 
 Mr. Lucas Dow, CEO Adani Mining,  said, “Adani Mining received advice today from the Queensland Government’s Department of Environment and Science that the Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems Management Plan (GDEMP) has been finalised and approved. Throughout the past eight years regional Queenslanders have been beside us every step of the way and we thank them for their on-going support. We’re ready to start work on the Carmichael Project and deliver the jobs these regions so badly need.” 

 
  
The approval states that the plan complies with all regulatory conditions set by the Australian and State Governments, bringing to a close a two-year process of rigorous scientific inquiry, review and approvals. This includes relevant reviews by Australia’s pre-eminent scientific organisations CSIRO and Geoscience Australia.   

   
The finalisation of the GDEMP and Black-throated Finch Management Plan paves the way for construction to commence on the Carmichael Project and the delivery of much needed jobs for regional Queenslanders. Moving forward, Adani Australia’s priority is ensuring the safety of everyone who works on the 

 
project and that all construction activity meets the strict environmental requirements we have agreed to meet in our management plans and approvals.  Over the coming day’s preparatory activities such as finalising contracts, mobilising equipment, recruitment and completing inductions will continue.   

 
These preparatory actions will enable us to then start construction activities including fencing, bridge and road upgrades, water management and civil earthworks on the mine site.   

 
The level of construction activity will then steadily increase over the coming weeks. The project will deliver 1,500 direct and 6,750 indirect jobs during ramp up and construction, with Rockhampton and Townsville the primary hubs for employment.   

 
The Whitsunday, Isaac, Central Highlands, Mackay, Charters Towers and Gladstone regions will also benefit from work packages and employment opportunities.

 Ahmedabad, India/Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 3 April 2017 –  Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), India’s biggest private port operating firm, will begin a feasibility study on building a greenfield multi-purpose port mainly for handling containers at Carey Island in Malaysia’s Selangor state, about 50 kms southwest of capital Kuala Lumpur. 

   

   

 The feasibility on developing a mega container handling port project on Carey Island as an extension of the existing Port Klang has been flagged off with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between APSEZ and MMC Port Holdings Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned unit of MMC Corporation Berhad (MMC), one of Malaysia’s top utilities and infrastructure group with diversified businesses ranging from ports and logistics, energy and utilities and engineering and construction. 

   

   

 “Malaysia is very strategic to APSEZ global strategy and with straits of Malacca being a global shipping route it helps us to drive our global transhipment strategy further. With Vizhinjam port on one side Carey Island port on the other we will be able to give transhipment solutions to global shipping lines. Malaysia with its supportive, transparent and proactive government policies makes it ideal destination for investment. MMC and Sime Darby are valued partners and with their involvement in these projects strengthens the case even more to make both these projects successful.” said Mr. Karan Adani, CEO - APSEZ 

   

   

  Simultaneously, MMC Port Holdings, Sime Darby Property Berhad and APSEZ have signed a separate MOU to study the feasibility of developing an integrated maritime city on Carey Island to support the planned new port. 

   

   

  The MOU was signed by MMC Port Director Dato' Sri Che Khalib Mohamad Noh, Sime Darby Property Managing Director Dato’ Jauhari Hamidi and APSEZ’s  President of Business Development Capt. Sandeep Mehta. 

   

   

  Apart from developing and running India’s biggest private port located at Mundra in the north-western state of Gujarat, APSEZ also is the country’s biggest container handler outside state control. The firm operates container handling facilities at its flagship Mundra Port as well as in Hazira Port, both in Gujarat on India’s western coast and at Kattupalli near Chennai in Tamil Nadu on the eastern coast. 

   

   

  APSEZ will soon start operating a new container handling facility it has built at Kamarajar Port at Ennore near Chennai. The firm is also building a mega container transhipment port at Vizhinjam on India’s southern tip located in Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. 

   

   

  Malaysia, which is South East Asia’s third largest economy, is looking to boost investments and growth through liberalisation. The overall infrastructure of Malaysia is one of the most developed in Asia and competes with some of the best developing countries of the world. Malaysia is also known for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure. 

   

   

  Dato’ Sri Che Khalib, who is also Group Managing Director of MMC Corporation, added, “MMC Port, Adani Ports and Sime Darby bring with them the necessary expertise to make this project a success.” 

   

   

  “MMC Port is proud to work with Adani Ports and Sime Darby Property, to drive this significant port development, which will bring substantial economic benefits to Malaysia”, said Dato’ Sri Che Khalib. “Our ports are located right in the shipping lane and all ships must pass through Malaysian ports regardless, which makes the country a suitable regional centre for the logistics hub”, he added. 

   

   

  Under the one-year MOU, MMC Port, Sime Darby Property and Adani Ports will collaborate and undertake the feasibility study for the Carey Island Port Project and the supporting integrated Maritime City. 

   

   

  “This MOU reinforces our belief in the strategic value of our land. The port and maritime city could spur the development of southern Selangor’s industrial belt further and Sime Darby is well positioned to support this vision,” said President and Group Chief Executive Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Mohd Bakke Salleh. 

   

   

  MMC Port Holdings is Malaysia’s largest port operating group and currently runs 5 terminals - Pelabuhan Tg Pelepas Sdn. Bhd., Johor Port Berhad, Northport (Malaysia) Bhd, Penang Port Sdn. Bhd., as well as a 20% stake in Red Sea Gateway terminal in Jeddah. MMC Port also operates two big logistics companies, Kontena Nasional and JP Logistics. 

   

   

  Sime Darby Property is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sime Darby Berhad, a Malaysia-based diversified multinational involved in key growth sectors such as plantation, industrial equipment, motors, property and logistics. Sime Darby Property is involved in property development, property investment and asset management, hospitality and leisure, with assets in Malaysia, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and the United Kingdom.

 Ahmedabad, March 17, 2017 : Adani Group, a global integrated infrastructure conglomerate, today hosted a high level delegation led by Ms. Annastacia Palaszczuk, Premier of Queensland, Australia at Mundra Port who reaffirmed Queensland government’s commitment to the $16.5 billion Carmichael mine project.  

   

 Last year, the Queensland state's department of environment and heritage protection (EHP) issued a final environmental authority (EA) for Adani's Carmichael Mine project in the Galilee Basin. The EA application was vigorously assessed by the department and acted on recommendations made by the land court.  

   

 Adani group is confident of fulfilling the strict conditions placed on the EA, including extra requirements based on the land court's recommendations and ensure this mine will not pose an unacceptable risk to the environment. 

 Earlier in the day, the delegation visited Mundra Port, the crown jewel of Adani Group’s infrastructure prowess and are scheduled to visit Kamuthi in Tamil Nadu to see the world’s largest solar project which generates 648 megawatts of green electricity.       

   

 Queensland premier, Ms. Palaszczuk said after the visit,  “I am very happy to be here at Mundra and it is wonderful to see the port to solar plant to Agri businesses of Adani and its associated infrastructure. Indians are a great community in Australia and the Indo-Australian relations are growing from strength to strength. The Australian Prime Minister will also be visiting India shortly and that shows the significance of the relationship. My visit here shows that Queensland supports the Adani project for its potential to create many jobs for regional Queensland and will also help boost the Indian economy. Queensland will also be part of the solar project of Adani and we are delighted to be part of Adani in that project too.”  

   

 “We extend a warm welcome to the Honourable Premier Ms Palaszczuk along with the mayoral delegation and are very pleased to showcase our world class infrastructure created at Mundra by Adani Group. Our mining project will create economic prosperity and creation of thousands of jobs for the people of regional Queensland. The Carmichael mine will help bring energy security to millions of Indians who do not have access to electricity. The Adani group is committed to nation building projects in the energy and infrastructure space which will create economic and social benefits for people of India and Australia,”   said Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group.  

   

 The Premier and delegation visit is also significant in terms of Indo-Australian trade partnership as it lays a foundation stone of trade and commerce, especially in natural resources. The project involves construction of a near-400km rail line from the Carmichael mine site to the Adani owned and operated bulk coal-loading facility at Abbott Point near Bowen.  

 “Adani is similarly proud to be bringing this project to fruition and thereby generate tens of thousands of jobs for regional Queensland while help providing electricity to millions of Indians. The project will lead towards the overall development of the region in leaps and bounds. Adani will use mining support services from Mackay-Bowen region, Rockhampton and Townsville have been shortlisted by Adani as a Fly In Fly Out hub. The Mackay-Bowen region will also provide Adani with port services, as well as become the HQ for Adani’s rail and port operations. ” said Mr. Jeyakumar Janakaraj, CEO, Adani Australia.  

   

 Adani Group ventured into Australia commenced in 2010 with the purchase of the Greenfield Carmichael Coal Mine in the Galilee Basin, Central Queensland, and the Port of Abbot Point near Bowen in North Queensland.  

   

 Our vision is to operate a vertically integrated model - with the extraction of coal from our Carmichael Mine, transported by rail to Abbot Point, and exported to meet consumer and business demands in offshore markets.  

   

 The project will build Australia's largest thermal coal mine in the north Galilee Basin approximately 160km north-west of Clermont in Central Queensland, linked by a standard gauge North Galilee Basin Rail Line to two terminals at Abbot Point Port near Bowen.  

   

 Over its 60 year of the mine’s life this major infrastructure will not only support Adani's operations, the railway line and port, but will also provide infrastructure for the development of other proposed mines, extending the mining boom and allowing more jobs to be generated now and into the future.  

   

 The benefits will extend locally, regionally and across Queensland providing much needed job opportunities and generating around $22 billion in state mining taxes and royalties in just the first half of the project life. This will assist much needed public funding to help deliver schools, hospitals, roads and other services and stimulating activity throughout the economy.

 The GoAP along with the integrated infrastructure conglomerate Adani Group will develop the hyper-scale data center market in the state, positioning AP as the east coast data center hub for India and South East Asia. It will also be integrated with a cable landing station that will take advantage of the state’s long coastline to help provide the needed global connectivity and redundancy that the country needs to manage its exponential growth of data. 

   

 In line with the State Government’s visionary, IT policy and focus on promoting data centers, cloud infrastructure, and allied technology industries as well as renewable energy, the Adani Group will support the development of the digital and energy infrastructure in the state by investing over Rs.70, 000 crore, over a period of 20 years which in turn is expected to create in excess of 100,000 direct and indirect jobs across the state. 

   

 The parks shall be developed across three different campuses, with each campus offering complementing value and together providing required redundancy and reliability to Data Center operators. The Data Center parks will be powered with 100% Renewable Energy that will be generated within the State of Andhra Pradesh thereby accelerating the renewable target goals put forward by the state. 

   

 
 Speaking on the occasion Hon’ble Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Nara Chandrababu Naidu said, “The State of Andhra Pradesh continues to raise the bar and set benchmarks as it strives tirelessly to become one of the top digital destinations in the world. From agriculture to financial markets to smart cities to healthcare, digitization is the future and will soon be a critical component of everything that we do. Efficient and eco-friendly Data Centers are the key to enabling this futuristic digital ecosystem. We are very pleased to see that the Adani Group believes in the vision of Andhra Pradesh as one of the most progressive states in India and hence, has decided to partner with the GoAP on this exciting journey.” 

   

 
 The Hon’ble Minister of Informational & Technology, Andhra Pradesh, Shri Nara Lokesh also said, “All the next generation technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, big data, image processing are changing the world around us and driving innovation in every single activity we do. Complementing the mobile revolution that we are witnessing, India needs data storage, data processing and data networking. This is precisely why the partnership between the GoAP and Adani Group is critical to lay the foundation of a digital revolution that every citizen and every business can benefit from.” 

   

 
 Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman Adani Group said, “It is a very proud moment for us to collaborate with GoAP to develop the world’s first green data center parks. Data centers are fundamental building blocks for enabling every aspect of the critical technology infrastructure that India needs to further accelerate its growth. In addition, the Adani group’s ability to provide 100% renewable power and its experience in energy management is a critical aspect towards lowering the carbon footprint for an industry that is now the world’s largest and growing power consuming industry”. 

   

 The move also marks, the Adani Group’s foray into the digital infrastructure sector that is now of significant national importance. Critically, it leverages the Adani Group’s vast experience in full stack energy management (renewable, baseload, transmission, and distribution) and strong project execution thereby making it uniquely qualified to deliver a practical 100% renewable data center infrastructure with a world class PUE. 

   

 This network of parks will be flexibly designed to adapt to emerging technology trends in the Data Center industry and will be scaled modularly to meet the customer demands. It will offer a unique energy supply value proposition to its customers. In addition, the data center parks will be transformational in enabling an entire ecosystem system of hardware suppliers, software application providers, start-up companies, and telecom ecosystem players thereby catalyzing innovation and creating the multiplier effect leading to tens of thousands of new jobs and generating increased tax collections.

Following the outbreak of the pandemic there is heightened awareness of quality products anchored on vectors of health wellness and immunity. There is a rising trend of 'at-home' as opposed to 'out-of-home' consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset consumers are also preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce frequency of purchase. Heightened concerns on hygiene and safety are also manifesting in consumers' preference for trusted brands. Consequently staples noodles biscuits dairy sanitizers hand wash floor cleaners etc. witnessed robust demand. On the other hand discretionary categories and those with relatively higher salience of 'out-of-home' consumption witnessed contraction. The Businesses significantly ramped up capacity in certain categories as heightened concerns on health & hygiene and uncertainty on the duration of lockdowns led to a surge in demand. The Branded Packaged Foods Businesses delivered a robust performance during the quarter driven by Atta Noodles Biscuits and Fresh Dairy. Most major categories gained market share during the quarter. - In the Staples Snacks and Meals category  'Aashirvaad' atta posted strong growth across markets. The brand further fortified its leadership position in the branded packaged atta industry during the quarter with significant value and volume growth. 'Yippee!' Noodles posted substantial growth driven by increased 'at-home' consumption and leveraging high-decibel brand campaigns. The 'Bingo!' Snacks category which saw subdued operational performance during the initial phase of the lockdown due to restricted mobility rapidly normalised after the restrictions of complete lockdown were lifted. - 'Sunfeast' Biscuits and Cakes recorded robust growth  driven mainly by surge in 'at home' consumption and the consumers' preference for trusted brands. Veda Marie launched last year continued to record impressive growth in all target markets. - In the Dairy & Beverages category  'Aashirvaad Svasti' range of fresh dairy products and ghee recorded strong growth. The range of milk products was augmented with the launch of Aashirvaad Svasti Lassi which has received encouraging consumer response.

The immunity range has met with encouraging response from discerning consumers. - The Chocolates and Confectionery categories  were severely impacted reflecting the subdued demand for discretionary products; these categories are witnessing progressive normalisation as the lockdowns are being eased across the country. The Personal Care Products Business recorded substantial growth in revenue driven by heightened awareness and demand for hygiene products such as hand sanitizers handwash antiseptic liquids and floor cleaners in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. However the 'Engage' range of fragrancing products witnessed a tepid quarter due to significant decline in demand. Demonstrating a high degree of agility and responsiveness to the market dynamics at play the Business rapidly expanded manufacturing capacity manifold and enhanced availability of 'Savlon' antiseptic liquid soap handwash hand sanitizer and 'Fiama' handwash products in the market. The newly set-up perfume manufacturing plant at Manpura Himachal Pradesh was re-purposed in quick time to manufacture hand sanitizers and service increased demand.

The Hygiene portfolio was augmented with the launch of 'Nimwash' - Vegetables & Fruit Wash Liquid - a 100% natural action solution made with Neem & Citrus extracts that assures the effective removal of pesticides and 99.9% germs from fruits & vegetables. The product has received encouraging response and is being scaled up. The Businesses continue to leverage state-of-the-art integrated consumer goods manufacturing facilities (ICMLs) to service proximal markets in a highly efficient and responsive manner. As stated earlier ESPB was severely impacted during the quarter due to deferment of new academic sessions and closure of educational institutions across the country. Proactive interventions such as online order taking Direct-to-Consumer delivery in select cities alternative hyperlocal delivery models ramping up availability through e-Com channels etc. are being pursued to mitigate the impact. The scenario in the short-term remains challenging with uncertainty around resumption timelines of academic sessions across various states. Notwithstanding this uncertainty the Company with its strong brands superior quality and environment-friendly paper robust product portfolio collaborative linkages with small & medium enterprises and superior distribution is well poised to strengthen its leadership position in the industry. The Agarbatti industry was confronted with significant operational challenges especially in the initial lockdown phase mainly due to higher focus of consumers and trade channels on essential products. Proactive steps taken by the Business have enabled it to stage a smart recovery in the month of June'20. The Business continues to focus on scaling up the availability of recently launched innovative products sustaining product superiority and enhancing supply chain efficiency to drive growth across all key segments. With effect from 1stApril 2020 GST rates for all safety matches irrespective of process of manufacture (mechanised/semi-mechanised units and 'handmade' safety matches) have been harmonised at 12% compared to 18% for mechanised/semi-mechanised and 5% for handmade matches earlier thereby levelling the playing field. Despite supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic the Business was able to quickly ramp up availability across markets and consolidate its market standing on the back of narrowing of the price gap of its products compared to competitors as a result of uniformity in GST rates. The Company responded with agility speed and resilience together with a structured process of proactive planning to operate in the 'new normal'. The Company fast tracked the design development and go-to-market strategy of new products and launched twelve innovative and relevant products in record time to meet the increasing demand for safety immunity and hygiene products. The significant surge in demand across categories in the portfolio was met through technology enabled solutions leveraging predictive analytics tools shortened demand planning cycles focus on fewer SKUs and higher-value packs backed by flexible manufacturing plans and responsive supply chain operations to cater to variability in demand. During the lockdown phase nearly two-thirds of the throughput was delivered direct to customer/market from factories leading to reduction in time-to-market which was a key consumer need given the anxiety around the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of concerted actions were taken to realign the distribution infrastructure so as to respond to the multiple challenges arising out of restricted mobility of people and goods curbs on working hours and outlet operations. Several technology-driven solutions were deployed to effectively service the surge in demand. The Company was the first in the industry to launch an online ordering system for retailers. The Company also facilitated swift scaling up of tele-calling and Whatsapp based order taking from retailers and deployed mechanised and non-mechanised delivery modes. The Company also pioneered an innovative model - ITC Store on Wheels - to directly service consumers in residential complexes (catered to 800+ unique residential societies in top markets). The exclusive 'ITC e-store' launched just prior to the implementation of the lockdown facilitated on-demand direct deliveries to consumers. The Company also enhanced the presence of its product portfolio in alternative channels and entered into collaboration with several companies such as Dominos Swiggy Zomato Dunzo to efficiently service consumers. The Company expanded its presence in the emerging channels of Modern Trade and e-Commerce during the quarter growing at over 20% and 90% respectively. In the Modern Trade channel the Company carried out direct store deliveries significantly reducing the time to market. It also scaled up presence on popular e-Commerce platforms on the back of  preference for contactless shopping and home delivery. Sales in rural markets grew rapidly leveraging the stockist channel. The Branded Packaged Foods Personal Care Products and the Agarbatti Businesses sustained their focus on deepening consumer engagement through refreshed and high decibel campaigns in conventional and social media platforms with contextual communication to enhance discoverability and stay relevant to consumers in challenging times. The Company leveraged its marketing command centre - 'Sixth Sense'- to deepen engagement with consumers through 'moment marketing' campaigns on social media platforms. The Company's employees trade partners transporters and their associates were provided extensive training - both online and at the place of work - in social distancing and personal protection. Standard Operating Processes (SOPs) were developed and implemented to ensure safe and hygienic work conditions both at the work place as well as in the market. The Company facilitated the process of obtaining insurance against COVID-19 for associates of trade partners and also rendered financial assistance in this regard thereby forging stronger ties with them. TOP Cigarettes Unprecedented disruption was witnessed across the value chain with manufacturing and selling & distribution operations being severely restricted following the imposition of lockdown. During the quarter manufacturing operations were resumed in mid-May and thereafter rapidly scaled up. Currently all factories are operational and production has been scaled up to pre-COVID levels. The sales & distribution operations have largely normalised. However re-imposition of localized lockdowns towards the end of June'20 and in recent weeks in certain parts of the country have caused closure of outlets and restrictions in operations in the containment zones posing operational challenges. The Company took focused actions during the quarter to consolidate its market standing. Deep consumer insights and a robust innovation pipeline enabled the Business to introduce new variants catering to the continuously evolving consumer preferences. Gold Flake Luxury filter in the Longs segment and Navy Cut Deluxe Filter Gold Flake Indie Mint and Capstan Fresh in the regular size filter segment were extended to target markets. The Business also introduced Gold Flake Super Star (Supermint) Gold Flake Star and Royal in the DSFT segment in competitive markets straddling key price points. The Flake brand was launched in an innovative 5s pack in target markets. During the quarter the Company leveraged its extensive footprint to quickly scale up availability through the grocery channel while the stockist network was augmented to service rural/semi-urban markets in an efficient manner. Discriminatory taxation on cigarettes has caused progressive migration from consumption of duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products comprising illegal cigarettes and bidi chewing tobacco Gutkha Zarda snuff etc. Rapid growth in illicit cigarette volumes has resulted in sub-optimisation of the revenue potential of the tobacco sector and significant loss to the Exchequer. It is estimated that on account of illegal cigarettes alone the revenue loss to the Government is almost Rs. 15000 crores per annum. While the share of legal cigarettes in total tobacco consumption in the country has declined considerably from 21% in 1981-82 to a mere 9% (against global average of 90%) aggregate tobacco consumption has increased over the same period. The stability in taxation between the sharp increase in July'17 under GST till the period up to January'20 provided some relief to the legal cigarette industry and lent buoyancy to tax collections. However this period of relative stability in taxes was halted with the sharp increase of 13% in tax incidence as a result of a significant hike in National Calamity Contingency Duty in February'20 thus providing a further fillip to this large and rapidly growing illicit cigarette trade in the country. In fact it is a matter of grave concern that while legal cigarettes trade was severely impacted smuggled cigarettes continued to be widely available despite the deterrent actions taken by the authorities to curb the menace. The inadvertent and unforeseen consequence of the stringent Indian tobacco regulations and discriminatory taxation continues to adversely impact the livelihood of Indian tobacco farmers with corresponding gains to tobacco farmers in the countries that have opted for moderate and equitable tobacco regulations. Notwithstanding the challenges as enumerated above the Company remains confident of fortifying its market standing in the legal cigarette industry by leveraging its superior strategies execution excellence investments in cutting-edge technology and a future ready product portfolio. Being the market leader the Company is well placed to capture all opportunities and emerge stronger with the continuing support of consumers. TOP Hotels The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the last quarter of FY20 continues to weigh heavily on the Hotels Business. Operations during the quarter came to a standstill with operations limited mainly to service stranded guests and wherever required as quarantine facilities. With severe restrictions on travel and heightened sensitivity around hygiene and social distancing revenue streams across all segments of operations have been significantly impacted. Negative operating leverage weighed on segment profits while aggressive reduction in controllable fixed costs partly mitigated the impact. The Business resumed operations in accordance with the prescribed guidelines from the second week of June'20 with a refreshed and revamped service design. To reassure guests at the Company's iconic Hotels and to provide best in class experience in hygiene and safety the ""WeAssure"" programme has been launched. This programme has been designed in collaboration with medical professionals and disinfection experts. The programme further enhances the existing hygiene and cleaning protocols across all hotels. The Business is also progressing towards an accreditation by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) for its procedures and is working on assurance of higher levels of hotel operating standards by DNV GL Business Assurance by building on the pillars of health hygiene safety and pathogen control. Several interventions have also been implemented by the Business to mitigate the impact of the challenging business environment and help bounce back stronger. These include customised packages for short getaways/staycations revamped packages with curated offers for the MICE (meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions) segment extension of additional benefits to members of the Club ITC loyalty programme launch of 'Lavenderia' - premium in-house Dry Cleaning & Laundry Service in select cities enhanced guest connect through sharing of contextual content in social media etc. For presenting unique cuisine experiences to discerning guests during the lockdown ITC Hotels launched 'Flavours' and 'Gourmet Couch' menus as home delivery and takeaway offerings. The Gourmet Couch menu consists of a medley of the finest cuisines from the signature restaurants at ITC Hotels with its iconic dishes like Dal Bukhara Dum Pukht Biryani Barrah Kebab etc. Crafted with care by ITC Hotels and handled with utmost attention to hygiene the mindfully created menus bring unique food experiences for diners across all major cities in India. The Business also partnered with food delivery platforms 'Zomato' and 'Swiggy' to enable wider availability of the offering. The initiative has been widely welcomed by the target customers. The Hotels and Foods Businesses together curated a first-of-its-kind cooking show '5 STAR Kitchen ITC Chef's Special'. The 12-episode series featuring delectable creations of 12 ITC masterchefs using the Company's food brands was aired on the STAR TV Network across 33 channels in 7 languages and Hotstar reaching an audience of 157 million. The content was also dubbed in 7 regional languages. While there are significant near-term challenges on account of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic the sector continues to hold immense potential in view of the robust long-term economic and tourism prospects of the country. With its portfolio of world-class properties iconic cuisine brands and best-in-class levels of service excellence anchored on 'Responsible Luxury' ethos and the highest standards of hygiene at all touchpoints the Company is well-positioned to sustain its pre-eminent position in the Indian Hospitality industry and to successfully overcome these challenges. TOP Agri Business The Agri Business recorded a growth of 3.7% in Segment Revenue driven by trading opportunities mainly in oilseeds and rice. The Business continued to leverage its strong farm linkages and wide sourcing network across geographies to secure supplies of critical grades of wheat with benchmark quality towards meeting the growing requirements of Aashirvaad atta. Despite the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic the Business pro-actively engaged with Centre and State authorities to secure permissions expeditiously to commence sourcing operations. The Business leveraged deep farmer connect built through over two decades of the e-Choupal network to scale up direct farm purchases. Together with the multi-modal procurement & supply chain model (covering network of transporters operating on road rail and coastal routes) the Business was able to ramp up the volume of wheat procurement substantially to cater to the surge in demand for Aashirvaad atta. During the quarter the Business also ramped up the direct milk sourcing network in West Bengal to cater to the increasing requirements on the back of the growing franchise of the Aashirvaad Svasti range of dairy products. The 'ITC Master Chef' range of Frozen Snacks posted robust growth in the retail channel. The range of Frozen Snacks was augmented with the launch of eight new exciting variants and the range was extended to 70+ cities during the quarter. Subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets and adverse business mix weighed on Segment Results. Despite operational challenges the leaf tobacco sub-segment ensured business continuity for key export customers by carrying out first level quality evaluation through internal teams leveraging knowledge of customer product standards offered substitute grades to mitigate disruptions in supply from other origin and leveraged technology to facilitate remote inspections. TOP Paperboards Paper & Packaging Segment revenue declined by 32.8% largely on account of the disruptions caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant growth in exports partly mitigated the weak domestic demand environment. While demand for paperboards and packaging from Pharma and FMCG end-user customer segments was relatively stable relatively subdued offtake in certain segments (e.g. liquor cupstock tobacco hosiery) and significant adverse impact in others (such as publications décor wedding cards etc.) impacted operational performance. The demand for writing and printing paper has also been impacted due to closure of educational institutions and offices in the wake of the pandemic. In the packaging sub-segment flexibles packaging witnessed robust demand while cartons packaging impacted by sluggish demand in the end-user segments as enumerated above was subdued. Swift resumption of business ahead of competition strong dealer network and agility in servicing customer needs aided in further strengthening market share in the Value Added Paperboards segment. Proactive investments made by the Business over the years to make structural interventions in the areas of strategic cost management and import substitution continue to aid margin expansion and strengthen competitive advantage. TOP Contribution to Sustainable Development ITC has been ranked #1 globally amongst peers (comprising companies with market capitalisation between USD 38 Bln. and USD 51 Bln.) and overall #3 globally on ESG performance in the Food Products industry by Sustainalytics - a renowned global ESG ratings company. ITC has been rated 'AA' by MSCI-ESG - the highest among global tobacco companies.

Over the past few weeks several initiatives have been implemented in response to the crisis. We are now happy to announce that ITC is setting up a Contingency Fund of Rs 150 crore to address and manage the challenges arising out of this adversity. This fund will be utilised primarily to provide relief to the vulnerable and most needy sections of society who have been harshly impacted by the pandemic and have faced significant disruption in their livelihoods. In addition the fund will collaborate with District Authorities to provide assistance to the district health and rural healthcare eco-system that reaches out to the weakest sections of society.

                                        ", Financial Results for the Quarter ended 31st December 2019  Highlights Post tax profit up 29%  FMCG-Others Segment Revenue up 6.1% on a comparable basis amidst continued slowdown in the FMCG industry. - Segment EBITDA up 48% to Rs. 256 crores notwithstanding higher marketing investments gestation and start-up costs of new categories/new facilities. Strong growth in existing properties and robust performance of new properties drive Hotels Segment Revenue (up 22.2%) and Segment EBITDA (up 40.1%). - ITC Royal Bengal Kolkata continues to set new benchmarks in culinary and service excellence in a relatively short span of time. - Welcomhotel Amritsar commissioned on 1st November 2019 receives excellent response. Paperboards Paper & Packaging Segment Revenue witnessed muted growth on a relatively firm base due to slowdown in the FMCG and liquor industry and depressed realisations on softening of global pulp prices. In the Agri Business segment  growth in Segment Revenue was driven by trading opportunities in oilseeds pulses & coffee and scaling up of value added segments (spices and frozen snacks). Subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets accentuated by relatively steeper depreciation in currencies of competing origins and adverse business mix weighed on Segment Results. Exceptional items represent cost of leaf tobacco stocks (including taxes) destroyed at a third party owned warehouse due to fire caused by lightning for which insurance claim has been filed and is under process. ITC has been ranked #1 globally amongst peers (comprising companies with market capitalisation between USD 38 Bln. and USD 51 Bln.) and overall #3 globally on ESG performance in the Food Products industry by Sustainalytics - a renowned global ESG ratings company. FMCG | Cigarettes | Hotels  Agri Business | Paperboards Paper & Packaging The macro-economic environment continues to be adversely impacted as reflected in deceleration in GDP growth and persistent weakness in consumption demand and investments. Delayed arrival of the Kharif crop due to spatial variations in rainfall especially close to the harvest season commodity price inflation together with disruptions in certain parts of the country exacerbated the already challenging operating environment during the quarter. Expectations of a good Rabi crop and a slew of measures announced by the Government in recent months including reduction in corporate tax rates initiatives to boost infrastructure and promote exports augur well for the revival of the economy. The Company posted a steady performance during the quarter amidst a particularly challenging operating environment as aforestated. Gross Revenue for the quarter stood at Rs. 11912.16 crores representing a growth of 5.0% driven mainly by Hotels Agri Business and FMCG-Others (excluding the Lifestyle Retailing Business). Profit after Tax at Rs. 4141.93 grew by 29.1%. Total Comprehensive Income stood at Rs. 3777.71 crores (previous year Rs. 3637.01 crores). Earnings Per Share for the quarter stood at Rs. 3.37. FMCG-Others The FMCG-Others  Segment delivered a resilient performance during the quarter which witnessed a slowdown in overall growth rates both in urban and rural markets. Categories with relatively higher rural salience remain the most impacted. The Company continues to mitigate the impact of the slowdown through several proactive measures such as enhancing direct reach introducing targeted relevant offers for value seeking consumers investing in fast growing channels and extending credit judiciously to select trade partners. Segment Revenue grew by 6.1% on a comparable basis (excluding the Lifestyle Retailing Business) with most major categories recording steady growth. Segment EBITDA grew by 48% to Rs. 256 crores with margins expanding by ~230 bps despite stepped up marketing investments gestation and start-up costs of new categories / new facilities and uptick in input costs.

Premium atta portfolio comprising Aashirvaad Select Aashirvaad Multigrain & Aashirvaad Sugar Release Control recorded strong growth. In the Snacks category the Tedhe Medhe range was augmented with the launch of two innovative variants - 'Herby Spin' and 'Chatpata Swing'. Shortage of potato due to extensive crop damage in parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra caused by excessive rainfall adversely impacted Bingo! potato chips sales. In the Instant Noodles category the Business introduced 'YiPPee! Quik Mealz Khow Suey' a delicious bowl of noodles designed for on-the-go consumption.  - In the Biscuits and Cakes Business the recently launched Bounce Cake variants continued to receive excellent response from consumers. During the quarter the portfolio was augmented with the launch of 'Sunfeast' Bounce Loops in three exciting flavours - Vanilla Chocolate and Jam.

TOP Cigarettes The Business sustained its leadership position in the industry through its unwavering focus on nurturing a portfolio of world-class brands anchored on superior consumer insights a robust innovation pipeline and superior product development capabilities. The Business continues to introduce new variants and augment its product portfolio catering to continuously evolving consumer preferences. Key market interventions in recent months include the launch of innovative and differentiated offerings such as Gold Flake Indie Mint Gold Flake Neo and Classic Rich & Smooth in the premium end deployment of focused offers under the 'American Club' 'Wave' 'Player's Gold Leaf' 'Pall Mall' and 'Flake' trademarks in strategic markets. Performance during the quarter reflects the persistent weakness in the overall demand environment especially in rural markets and wholesale channel tight market liquidity conditions and the increasing salience of illicit trade especially at the premium end. Extremely stringent regulations along with a punitive and discriminatory taxation regime on cigarettes in recent years have had numerous negative albeit unintended repercussions. These include: - decline in legal cigarette volumes in favour of lightly taxed and tax-evaded tobacco products resulting in sub-optimisation of the revenue potential of the tobacco sector and significant loss to the Exchequer. It is estimated that on account of illegal cigarettes alone the revenue loss to the Government is more than Rs. 13000 crores per annum. - further fillip to the growth of illegal cigarettes in the absence of statutory pictorial and textual warnings on smuggled international brands. As a result despite accounting for less than 1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5ths of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector. - widespread availability of illegal cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices. - a large component of tobacco consumption in the country aggregating around 68% remaining outside the tax net. - persistent negative impact on the livelihood of tobacco farmers and others dependent on tobacco. Studies by the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) indicate that on account of agro-climatic conditions there is no equally remunerative alternate crop that can be grown in the FCV tobacco growing regions of the country.  It may be recalled that tax incidence on cigarettes increased by over 20% in 2017-18 representing the combined impact of transition to GST and increase in Excise Duty announced in the Union Budget 2017. While stability in taxes since the introduction of GST in July 2017 has provided some relief to the legal cigarette industry volumes remain significantly below June 2014 levels. Moderation in taxes is critical for addressing the interests of all the stakeholders of this industry including the tobacco farmers the Exchequer and the consumers. As in the past the Company continues to make representations to policy makers for equitable non-discriminatory pragmatic evidence based regulations and taxation policies that balance the economic imperatives of the country and the tobacco control objectives cognising for the unique tobacco consumption pattern in India. TOP Hotels The Business posted a strong performance during the quarter with Segment Revenue and Segment EBITDA growing by 22.2% and 40.1% respectively. There was all-round improvement with both existing and new properties recording robust increase in RevPAR and F&B sales. Higher room rates and operating leverage aided margin expansion.

TOP Agri Business Segment Revenue grew by 8.8% as the Business leveraged trading opportunities especially in Oilseeds Pulses & Coffee and scaled up its portfolio of value-added products. Subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets relatively steeper depreciation in currencies of competing origins and adverse business mix weighed on Segment Results.

Milk sourcing network in West Bengal continues to be scaled up to support the growing franchise of the Aashirvaad Svasti range of dairy products. The Business continues to focus on strengthening its portfolio of value-added products to cater to the specific requirements of the food service channel. TOP Paperboards Paper & Packaging Performance of the Paperboards Paper & Packaging Segment continued to be impacted by the subdued demand environment prevailing in the FMCG and liquor industry. While the Paperboards Business witnessed volume growth in Value Added Paperboard segment a sharp correction in global pulp prices exerted pressure on realisations. The Business continues to make structural interventions in the areas of strategic cost management improvement in operational efficiencies and import substitution towards enhancing its market standing and competitive advantage.

FMCG | Cigarettes | Hotels  Agri Business | Paperboards Paper & Packaging  Financial year ended 31st March 2020 FMCG-Others Segment Revenueup appx. 5% on a comparable basis (excluding the Lifestyle Retailing Business). -Robust growth in Segment EBITDA (up 32.8% to 914 cr.) driven by enhanced scale product mix enrichment and strategic cost management initiatives notwithstanding increase in input costs sustained investments in brand building gestation costs of new categories start-up costs of new facilities and impact due to disruptions following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. -Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic the FMCG-Others segment was on track to register double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter on a comparable basis. The Education and Stationery Products Business (ESPB) which reported strong growth till February 2020 was severely impacted in the peak month of March 2020 due to closure of educational institutions and deferment of new academic sessions across states pursuant to nation-wide lockdown. -Comparable revenue growth (excluding ESPB and Lifestyle Retailing Business) stood at appx. 5% during the fourth quarter. -Strong momentum has been witnessed in essential consumer goods and the Company has ramped up capacity to service surge in demand across categories. Demand in the Education & Stationery products continued to be subdued pending resumption of the educational institutes. The Hotels Business posted strong growth in Segment Revenue and Segment Results of appx. 19% and 29% respectively during the first nine months of the year. This momentum was sustained in January'20 and February'20. However the Business was severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic towards the end of the year. In the first 9 months Agri Business witnessed strong revenue growth of appx. 15% driven by trading opportunities in oilseeds & pulses and scale-up of the value-added portfolio especially spices frozen shrimps and frozen snacks. Subdued demand for leaf tobacco  in international markets relatively steeper depreciation in currencies of competing origins and adverse business mix weighed on Segment Results. Performance in the fourth quarter was impacted due to supply chain disruptions towards the end of the year caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Operations in the Agri Business have since then normalized. In the Paperboards Paper & Packaging Segment  while capacity addition in the Value Added Paperboards segment bolstered Revenue slowdown in customer offtake due to sluggish demand in end-user industries weighed on the performance of the packaging segment. Despite the adverse impact on Revenue in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions following the outbreak of the pandemic towards the end of the year Segment Results were up 5.3% driven by higher in-house pulp production enhanced operating efficiencies and benign input costs. In the Union Budget 2020 a steep increase in National Contingent Calamity Duty on cigarettes was announced w.e.f. 1st February 2020. Towards the end of the year the COVID-19 pandemic caused operational disturbances even before the nation-wide lockdown. During the initial phase of the lockdown unprecedented disruption was witnessed across the value chain which impacted Segment Revenue and Segment Results. However all factories are currently operational and sales & distribution operations are progressively normalising. Free Cash Flow generation (net of tax and capital expenditure) during the year stood at Rs.11693 crores representing a robust growth of 30% over the previous year. The Company remains the clear leader in the FMCG industry in terms of annual Free Cash Flow generation. The Company was one of the fastest off the blocks to resume operations after obtaining necessary permissions in the lockdown phase with safety and employee well-being accorded paramount importance. Capacity has been significantly ramped up to meet the surge in demand for essential consumer goods. While essential consumer goods have witnessed buoyancy in demand discretionary categories is likely to recover over time; the Company is approaching the future with due caution in light of the heightened uncertainty in the environment. On 23rd May 2020 the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') to acquire 100% of the equity share capital of Messrs. Sunrise Foods Private Limited (SFPL)  an Indian company primarily engaged in the business of spices under the trademark 'Sunrise' subject to fulfilment of various terms and conditions as specified in the SPA.

Several initiatives were taken which include contribution of Rs.100 cr. to PMCARES fund contribution of Rs.28 cr. to CMs' Relief Fund across states assistance through distribution of dry/cooked food distribution of food and personal hygiene products to frontline staff migrant labour healthcare professionals and rendering support directly or through NGOs to the needy etc. TOP Financial Performance The macro-economic environment for the year under review was particularly challenging marked by deceleration in economic activity accentuated by a sharp decline in consumption especially in rural areas. Just as the business environment was showing signs of an incipient recovery in the beginning of the fourth quarter the onset of COVID-19 pandemic changed the situation dramatically. In the initial stages the contagion had a significant impact on the Hotels and Education and Stationery Products businesses as it coincided with the peak period and the onset of the school season respectively. The Cigarettes Business consolidated its market standing during the year through continued focus on delivering world-class products along with best-in-class execution. However persistent weakness in the demand environment coupled with growth in illicit cigarette trade weighed on performance. Steep increase in taxes w.e.f. 1st February 2020 and disruptions in operations in March 2020 exacerbated the situation. In the FMCG-Others Segment comparable revenue grew ahead of the industry amidst subdued demand conditions while profitability improved significantly. Segment EBITDA margins improved by appx. 160 bps to 7.1% during the year despite heightened competitive intensity early closure of educational institutions that impacted the Education & Stationery Products Business elevated input costs gestation costs of new products/categories and manufacturing facilities andimpact due to disruptions following the outbreak of the pandemic.In the Hotels Business while the first three quarters witnessed strong performance driven largely by excellent response to the Company's new iconic properties the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted performance in the fourth quarter. Sluggish growth in end-user industries such as FMCG Pharma and Liquor resulted in muted customer offtake in the Paperboards Paper and Packaging segment; margin expansion was driven by higher in-house pulp production enhanced operating efficiencies and benign input costs. While trading opportunities in oilseeds & pulses and scale-up of the value-added portfolio were the key drivers of revenue growth in the Agri Business segment subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets accentuated by relatively steeper depreciation in currencies of competing origins and adverse business mix weighed on Segment Results. Overall for FY 2019/20 Gross Revenue at Rs.46323.72 crores increased by 2.4% while PBT (before exceptional items) at Rs.19298.92 cr. grew by 4.6% over FY 2018/19. Profit after Tax grew at a faster pace of 21.4% to Rs.15136.05 crores aided by reduction in corporate income tax rates during the year (net of calibration in pricing). Exceptional items during the year represent cost of leaf tobacco stocks (including taxes) destroyed at a third party owned warehouse due to fire for which insurance claim has been filed and is under process. Earnings Per Share for the year stood at Rs.12.33 (previous year Rs.10.19). The Directors are pleased to recommend an Ordinary Dividend of Rs.10.15per share (previous year Ordinary Dividend of Rs.5.75 per share) for the year ended 31st March 2020. Total cash outflow in this regard will be Rs.12476.61  crores. FMCG-Others FMCG industry growth decelerated sharply during the year due to sluggish demand conditions tight market liquidity and delayed monsoons followed by excessive rainfall in certain parts of the country. Overall industry growth rates halved to ~7% in Q3 FY20 compared to same period last year with the situation getting worse in Q4 FY20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdowns across the country. Rural markets which account for around one-third of the industry and have been the key driver of growth in recent years witnessed a steep fall in growth rates. Rural growth stood at 0.8x of urban markets in FY20 compared to 1.4x in FY19. Despite the challenging conditions prevailing during the year and the significant slowdown following the outbreak of the pandemic the Company's FMCG-Others businesses recorded Segment Revenue of Rs.12844.23 crores representing an increase of 5% over the previous year (on comparable basis excluding the Lifestyle Retailing Business). Most major categories enhanced their market standing during the year. Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic the FMCG-Others segment was on track to register double-digit revenue growth for the fourth quarter on a comparable basis.  Segment EBITDA for the year registered robust growth of 32.8% to Rs.914 crores with significant margin expansion of ~160 bps. This was driven by enhanced scale product mix enrichment reduced distance-to-market and other strategic cost management initiatives after absorbing the impact of sustained investment in brand building gestation costs of new categories & facilities and theimpact due to disruptions following the outbreak of the pandemic. TOP Branded Packaged Foods Against the backdrop of an extremely challenging operating environment the Company sustained its position as one of the fastest growing branded packaged foods businesses in the country leveraging a robust portfolio of brands a slew of first-to-market offers a range of distinctive products customised to address regional tastes and preferences along with an efficient supply chain and distribution network. Whilst the Business was on track to register a double-digit revenue growth in the last quarter of the financial year the momentum was severely disrupted by the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Business operations were severely impacted with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent nationwide lockdown. However the Company was able to successfully overcome these challenges and resume operations within a very short time frame. The categories in the essential consumer goods space viz. staples noodles biscuits dairy etc. witnessed robust demand reflecting consumer preference for trusted brands; demand for discretionary categories was relatively soft. The Business also ramped up capacity in certain categories to cater to surge in demand. The Branded Packaged Foods Businesses remain focused on addressing emerging consumer needs and are anchoring innovations on the vectors of health wellness immunity and naturals to address heightened concerns in these areas in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Staples Business Aashirvaad atta fortified its market standing across geographies leveraging a robust product portfolio anchored on the Company's agri-sourcing expertise. The range of value-added products was augmented with the launch of Aashirvaad Nature's Super Foods a differentiated range of products comprising Gluten Free Flour Ragi Flour and Multi-Millet Mix which are naturally gluten free rich in dietary fibre and a source of protein. Supported by its new positioning 'Created by Sun and Sea - pure just like nature intended it to be' Aashirvaad Salt gained traction in key focus geographies and posted a healthy performance during the year. In the Spices category during the year the Company expanded its geographical footprint to 17 states and recorded healthy volume growth. Increasing consumer traction for 'Bingo!' Potato Chips and Tedhe Medhe continued to drive growth in the Snacks Business. Tedhe Medhe continues to be the most widely distributed snack brand in the country. The Tedhe Medhe range was augmented with the launch of two innovative variants - 'Herby Spin' and 'Chatpata Swing'. The Business continues to be the market leader in the bridges sub-segment and improved its market standing in potato chips. In the Instant Noodles category YiPPee! noodles sustained its growth momentum and overall market standing as a strong competitive #2 brand in the noodles space. YiPPee! led the industry in terms of packaging innovation in family packs enabling impactful visibility reducing breakages and driving growth in Modern Trade.  In the Biscuits category Dark Fantasy Choco Fills sustained its high growth trajectory driven by superior product attributes focused communication efficient distribution and consumer activation. The recently launched innovative offers such as Bounce Cake variants 'Sunfeast' Veda Marie Light Bounce Loops continue to receive excellent response from consumers and are now available in all target markets. The Business consolidated its leadership position in the super-premium segment with continued focus on enhancing brand affinity and increasing penetration in emerging channels of Modern Trade & e-commerce platforms. In the Confectionery Business multi-unit packs and higher salience of 'Re. 1 and above' products contributed to portfolio premiumisation. 'Candyman' Fantastik continues to make rapid strides and garner increasing consumer traction across markets.  In the Dairy & Beverages Business the 'B Natural' range of juices anchored on the proposition of '100% Indian Fruit 0% concentrate' with the added 'goodness of fibre' continues to deepen consumer connect by providing a more nutritive and 'natural' tasting experience. The premium range of juices with fruit inclusions in an appealing transparent bottle format comprising unique region-specific fruits viz. Ratnagiri Alphonso Himalayan Mixed Fruit and Dakshin Guava continued to receive excellent response from consumers and is now available in all target markets.  The 'Aashirvaad Svasti' fresh dairy portfolio comprising pouch milk pouch curd and paneer gained strong consumer traction on the back of high quality standards and superior taste profile in Bihar and West Bengal where the portfolio is currently available. Aashirvaad Svasti Ghee continues to gain excellent product feedback and is witnessing good traction especially in Modern Trade and e-commerce channels. Similarly the 'Sunfeast Wonderz Milk' range of milk shakes has received encouraging response and is being extended to other markets. 'Fabelle' chocolates continue to receive excellent response from discerning consumers. During the year the Business adopted a focused geography approach backed by innovative brand campaigns on digital platforms increasing its presence in stores across Bengaluru in Modern Trade & Independent Service Stores in select metro cities. The Business implemented several initiatives to improve profitability encompassing strategic cost management supply chain optimisation smart procurement and productivity improvement through automation leveraging new-age tools such as Industry 4.0 and Smart Utilities which helped in mitigating escalation in input costs and absorbing start-up costs of new Integrated Consumer goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICML) facilities and strategic investments in brand building for new categories viz. Dairy Juices Chocolates and Coffee. TOP Personal Care Products The Company's Personal Care Products Business consolidated its market standing across categories driven by sustained focus on innovation portfolio premiumisation and expansion of distribution reach both in traditional trade as well as e-commerce. While 'Fiama' bodywash and handwash 'Vivel' bodywash 'Savlon' Handwash and antiseptic liquid and 'Nimyle' floor cleaner witnessed robust growth performance in the bar soaps and fragrancing products categories was relatively subdued in line with the slowdown in consumer demand witnessed during the year.  In the Personal Wash & Hygiene category the Business augmented the 'Fiama' bodywash range with the launch of 'Fiama' Scents in two exciting variants thereby strengthening the brand's 'mood upliftment' value proposition. The Business also introduced a first-of-its-kind Fiama 'mood uplifting' handwash in the premium segment with three refreshing variants. Towards the end of the financial year heightened awareness for personal hygiene in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in demand for products in the 'Health and Hygiene' portfolio such as hand sanitizers handwash antiseptic liquids and floor cleaners. Demonstrating a high degree of agility and responsiveness to the market dynamics at play the Business rapidly expanded manufacturing capacity manifold and enhanced availability of the 'Savlon' antiseptic liquid soap handwash hand sanitizer and 'Fiama' handwash products in the market. The newly setup perfume manufacturing plant at Manpura Himachal Pradesh was re-purposed in quick time to manufacture hand sanitizers and service increased demand. The Business also launched two innovative products in record time - 'Savlon Surface Disinfectant Spray' and 'Savlon Hexa' hand sanitizing liquid for quick and persistent action. The development and the subsequent launch of these products across India in a short span of time is a testament to innovative and passionate teams working round the clock to fight against the virus and keep India safe. In the Fragrances category 'Engage' consolidated its position as the second largest brand in the category. 'Engage' sustained its clear market leadership position in the Pocket Perfume segment despite intense competition. The Business continued to expand its presence in the Floor Cleaner category leveraging the recently acquired 'Nimyle' brand. During the year Nimyle witnessed strong growth in the East and also expanded its geographical footprint to the South to become the 3rd largest brand nationally in a relatively short span of time. The Business continued to strengthen its presence in the premium skincare space through its 'Dermafique' brand and in the popular space through 'Charmis'. During the year Dermafique's Hydration range was extended with launch of 2 new variants tailor-made for summer skincare needs. The brand is now available on all key e-commerce platforms and continues to receive encouraging consumer response. TOP Education and Stationery Products The Education and Stationery Products industry was adversely impacted during the year due to sluggish demand and tight liquidity conditions. The situation was exacerbated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic towards the close of the year which led to postponement of the academic session across the country. This also coincided with the peak season for sales. Notwithstanding the challenging business environment the Business was on track to deliver a double-digit revenue growth prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. The Business sustained its clear market leadership position in the industry leveraging a portfolio of world-class brands and products continued strategic interventions towards strengthening supply chain efficiencies and a deep and wide distribution network.  During the year the 'Classmate' product portfolio was augmented with the launch of first-to-market innovative variants while the premium 'Paperkraft' portfolio was enriched with the launch of super premium pens with world-class technology and leather-bound notebook organiser. The Business also scaled up presence in the college and value segment of the notebook industry through the 'Classmate Pulse' and 'Saathi' brands respectively with a view to consolidating its leadership position.  During the year the Business commissioned a dedicated facility for manufacturing notebooks. Equipped with state-of-the-art machinery the facility provides the Business with the capability to develop innovative and highly differentiated notebook formats drive cost reduction through process automation and higher operational efficiencies and exploit opportunities in the overseas markets. Incense Sticks (Agarbattis) and Safety Matches The Mangaldeep brand sustained its leadership position in the Dhoop category and consolidated its position as the second largest brand in the Agarbatti category with all-round improvement in brand measures. During the year the Business launched the Mangaldeep Temple 'Fragrance of God' range of products anchored on the core proposition of 'bringing home the divinity of the temple'.The Business also introduced an innovative 'Lo smoke' variant which emits 80% lesser smoke than regular agarbattis.Consumer response to these interventions have been very encouraging.  While demand conditions in the Safety Matches industry remained sluggish the Business sustained its market leadership position through portfolio premiumisation and by leveraging a robust portfolio of offerings across market segments.  With effect from 1st April 2020 GST rates for all safety matches irrespective of process of manufacture (mechanized/semi-mechanised units and 'handmade' safety matches) have been harmonised at 12% compared to 18% for mechanized/semi-mechanised and 5% for handmade matches earlier. The harmonized rates offer a level playing field for the organized players who were disadvantaged earlier and will enable the Company to strengthen its market standing. TOP Cigarettes  A punitive and discriminatory taxation and regulatory regime along with a sharp increase in illegal trade in recent years especially at the premium end continue to pose significant challenges to the legal cigarette industry in the country. Performance during the year under review was additionally impacted by persistent weakness in overall demand environment especially in rural markets and wholesale channel and tight market liquidity conditions. Towards the end of the year the COVID-19 pandemic caused operational disturbances even before the nation-wide lockdown. During the initial phase of the lockdown unprecedented disruption was witnessed across the value chain. Howeverall factories are currently operational and sales & distribution operations are progressively normalising. Immediately upon receipt of permissions the Company was able to resume operations and swiftly ramp up production and availability of its brands across markets. This is a testimony to the extraordinary resilience and deep commitment of the Company's workforce and business partners. Notwithstanding the extremely challenging operating landscape and the headwinds faced during the year under review the Company sustained its leadership position in the cigarette industry including modern variants through its unwavering focus on nurturing a portfolio of world-class products superior consumer insights a strategy of continuous innovation and superior product development capabilities. Several new variants were introduced during the year to cater to the continuously evolving consumer preference and ensure the future readiness of the Company's product portfolio. Key market interventions during the year include the launch of innovative and differentiated offerings at the premium end such as Gold Flake Indie Mint & Gold Flake Luxury and the extension of Gold Flake Neo & Classic Rich & Smooth to other markets. The Business also deployed focused offers under the 'American Club' 'Wave' 'Player's Gold Leaf' 'Pall Mall' 'Navy Cut' and 'Flake' trademarks in strategic markets towards bolstering and strengthening its market standing. While stability in taxation between the sharp increase in July'17 under GST till the period up to Jan'20 provided some relief to the legal cigarette industry and lent buoyancy to tax collections industry volumes remained significantly below June 2014 levels. This period of relative stability in taxes was halted with the sharp increase of 13% in tax incidence as a result of a significant hike in National Calamity Contingency Duty in February 2020. It is pertinent to note that since 2016-17 i.e. pre-GST taxes on cigarettes have increased by 40% i.e. at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 12% (on a comparable basis) - over thrice the rate of inflation during the same period.  Discriminatory taxation on cigarettes has caused progressive migration from consumption of duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products comprising illegal cigarettes and bidi chewing tobacco Gurkha Zarda snuff etc. Consequently while the share of legal cigarettes in total tobacco consumption in the country has declined considerably from 21% in 1981-82 to a mere 9% (against global average of 90%) aggregate tobacco consumption has increased over the same period. Illicit cigarette trade in the country has been growing at an alarming rate. Euromonitor International ranks India as the 4th largest illicit cigarette market globally - a dubious distinction arising due to punitive taxation of cigarettes which has created a hugely attractive tax arbitrage and extremely lucrative opportunities for unscrupulous players. While legal cigarette industry volumes have declined by about 20% between 2010/11 and 2019/20 the illicit duty-evaded cigarette segment has grown by 36% during the same period accounting for about one-fourth of the domestic industry and making India one of the fastest growing illicit cigarette markets in the world. The 13% increase in cigarette taxes with effect from 1st February 2020 as aforementioned will provide further fillip to the large and rapidly growing illicit cigarette trade in the country.  The regulatory framework for cigarettes in the country is one of the strictest in the world. The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce Production Supply and Distribution) Act 2003 (COTPA) require cigarette packages to bear the statutorily mandated pictorial and textual warnings covering 85% of the surface area of the packet (one of the largest in the world). Smuggled illegal cigarettes do not bear any of the mandated pictorial or textual warnings or bear much smaller pictorial warnings as per the tobacco laws of the countries from where these cigarettes are sourced. As reported in prior years findings from research conducted by IMRB International an independent market research organisation show that the lack of pictorial warnings on packets of smuggled cigarettes or their diminutive size creates a perception in the consumer's mind that smuggled cigarettes are 'safer' than domestic duty-paid cigarettes that carry the 85% pictorial warnings. Along with low prices to consumers enabled through tax evasion this has opened the floodgates for contraband cigarettes. The large and rapidly growing illicit cigarette trade also has a deleterious impact on the millions of farmers and farm workers engaged in the tobacco value chain. In India cigarettes are manufactured largely using Flue Cured Virginia Tobacco (FCV) grown in the states of Andhra Pradesh Telangana and Karnataka. FCV tobaccos are also traded internationally and India is an exporter of this commodity. Since smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not use Indian tobaccos in addition to revenue losses the growth of the illegal cigarette trade has also resulted in a severe drop in demand for Indian FCV tobaccos in the domestic market. Along with decline in leaf exports (due to lower availability of Indian crop favourable prices of competing origins and lower export incentives) this has adversely impacted earnings of the Indian tobacco farmer. It is pertinent to note that several other major tobacco producing countries including the USA have framed regulatory frameworks for tobacco taking into consideration the economic interests of their tobacco farmers. The inadvertent and unforeseen consequence of the stringent Indian tobacco regulations and discriminatory taxation continues to adversely impact the livelihood of Indian tobacco farmers with corresponding gains to tobacco farmers in the countries that have opted for moderate and equitable tobacco regulations. These developments have had a devastating impact on 46 million livelihoods including the Indian tobacco farmer dependent on the Tobacco Value Chain. It is estimated that since 2013-14 Indian tobacco farmers have suffered a cumulative drop in earnings of appx. Rs.5175 crores. Stability in taxes on cigarettes will have the salutary effect of enabling the legal cigarette industry to claw back volumes thereby engendering domestic demand for Indian tobaccos. This will also help cushion the impact of volatility in international markets. TOP Hotels  2019-20 turned out to be a mixed bag for the domestic Hospitality industry. While General Elections and sluggish economic activity weighed on occupancy and room rates during the first half of the year the second half witnessed a pick-up in growth momentum driven by increase in inbound & domestic tourism meetings & conventions and retail segments. Reduction in GST rates announced in September 2019 also contributed to the recovery. The revival in demand was however short-lived with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic the impact of which was felt as early as February 2020 severely disrupting operations. The Travel & Hospitality sector is amongst the most severely impacted ones in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. With severe restrictions in travel for business as well as leisure and heightened sensitivity around hygiene and social distancing revenue streams across all segments of operations have been significantly impacted. Segment Revenue for the 9 months ended 31st December 2019 recorded robust growth of 19% appx. driven mainly by the newer properties in the portfolio. Segment EBITDA grew faster at 34% appx. on the back of higher RevPar and operational leverage notwithstanding gestation costs of the new properties. The impact of COVID-19 weighed on performance for the fourth quarter leading to full year Segment Revenue growth of 10% appx. toRs.1837 cr. and Segment EBITDA growth of 12% appx. toRs.420 cr. Recently commissioned Hotels - ITC Kohenur Hyderabad and ITC Grand Goa Resort & Spa Goa - scaled up operations rapidly and strengthened customer franchise to establish themselves as leading hotels in their respective markets. During the year the Business commissioned ITC Royal Bengal Kolkata. Located adjacent to ITC Sonar and in close proximity to the new business districts of Kolkata this 'One of A Kind' luxury hotel is an ode to the region's cultural heritage and lineage. In its first year of operations the hotel has been able to establish a pre-eminent position in the luxury hospitality & Meetings Incentives Conferences and Exhibitions landscape of the region besides being the most sought after F&B and banquets destination in the city. The Welcomhotel portfolio was augmented with the addition of Welcomhotel Amritsar. The Business also made steady progress during the year in the construction of a Luxury Collection hotel in Ahmedabad Welcomhotel Bhubaneswar & Welcomhotel Guntur. In recent years the Company has adopted an 'asset-right' strategy that envisages a large part of incremental room additions going forward to accrue through management contracts. The Company continues to successfully build on this strategy with a steady pipeline of managed properties - a Welcomhotel conveniently located close to the business districts at GST Road Chennai was opened during the year. While there are significant near-term challenges on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic the sector continues to hold immense potential in view of the robust long-term economic and tourism prospects of the country. With its portfolio of world-class properties iconic cuisine brands and best-in-class levels of service excellence anchored on 'Responsible Luxury' ethos and the highest standards of hygiene at all touchpoints the Company is well-positioned to sustain its pre-eminent position in the Indian Hospitality industry and to successfully overcome these challenges. TOP Agri Business After declining for 6 years in a row global production of Flue Cured tobacco in 2019 remained stable at around 3470 million kgs. Indian Flue Cured tobacco supplies are stabilizing at around 220-230 million kgs. However it still remains far below the levels of 2014 representing a drop of over 30%. A punitive and discriminatory taxation and regulatory regime on cigarettes apart from severely impacting the domestic legal Cigarette industry has also resulted in significant pressure on the leaf tobacco crop grown in India. This together with declining trend of global cigarette demand excess production in certain geographies relative strength of the Indian Rupee compared to currencies of competing origins lower export incentives and heightened illicit trade in cigarettes has culminated in reduced demand for Indian tobacco. Consequently leaf tobacco exports have declined by more than 25% over the last six years to 174 million kgs. in 2019-20.  Despite such challenging market conditions the Company consolidated its leadership position as the largest Indian exporter of unmanufactured tobacco. This was achieved through new business development and enhanced value delivery to existing customers by leveraging the Business's expertise in crop development superior product integrity and sourcing and world-class processing facilities. To offset the declining offtake by global majors the Business has acquired several new customers in recent years generating substantial revenue during the year. The Business continued to provide strategic sourcing support to the Company's Cigarettes Business meeting all requirements at competitive prices. The Business continued to leverage its strong farm linkages and wide sourcing network across geographies to secure supplies of critical grades of wheat with benchmark quality towards meeting the growing requirements of Aashirvaad atta. During the year the Business further scaled up its strategic sourcing and supply chain interventions. These include focused crop development towards securing the right varieties for Aashirvaad atta with a view to providing consumers best-in-class product quality and experience use of multi-modal transportation comprising rail road & coastal routes and blend/cost optimisation through geographical and varietal arbitrage.  The growth in the external business was largely driven by opportunity trading in oil seeds pulses and rapid scale up in value added portfolio especially spices frozen shrimps and frozen snacks. The Business leveraged its extensive sourcing network and associated infrastructure in key growing areas coupled with deep-rooted farmer linkages to source high quality fruit pulp for the Company's 'B Natural' juices brand. During the year the Business also strengthened its milk procurement network for 'Aashirvaad Svasti' dairy products with significant increase in daily milk collection. The Business expanded its network in West Bengal and Bihar to support the growing requirement for fresh dairy products and in Punjab towards supporting the increasing requirements of 'Sunfeast Wonderz Milk' dairy beverages. The Agri Business remains focused on enhancing its presence in identified high value-added segments viz. spices for 'food-safe' markets processed fruits frozen marine products etc. This includes the 'ITC Master Chef' range of 'Super Safe' frozen prawns which adhere to stringent standards prevalent in USA Europe and Japan. Launched in eight cities leveraging the Company's experience of catering to customers in international markets the range has been well appreciated for its taste and quality. During the year the 'ITC Master Chef' range of frozen snacks was augmented with the launch of a unique range of kebabs for the retail segment. The frozen snacks range currently comprising 11 vegetarian and 6 non-vegetarian delicacies is available in over 50 cities and is gaining good consumer traction. Performance in the fourth quarter was impacted due to supply chain disruptions amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to lower exports and domestic sales towards the end of the year. To ensure steady support to the Branded packaged foods Business as also to support the agri sector during this critical time the Business was able to secure necessary permissions expeditiously to ramp up agri operations including direct buying from farmers leveraging its e-Choupal network to expand the buying locations at the village level to overcome labour and transport challenges from the market yards which were non-operational during March and April. The Business also leveraged its supply chain network and ensured transportation through multiple modes with due adherence to necessary safety protocols and with necessary support both from the administration and supply chain partners. The Company's Agri Business with its deep rural linkages and agri-commodity sourcing expertise is well positioned to scale up in identified areas that lend to higher value addition while continuing to provide strategic sourcing support to the Company's Branded Packaged Foods Businesses. TOP Paperboards Paper & Packaging After witnessing a robust 2018-19 in terms of strong end-user demand and higher realisations on the back of higher pulp prices the Paper and Paperboard industry remained relatively muted in 2019-20. General economic slowdown sharp fall in rural demand and tight liquidity conditions impacted end-user demand across segments. Against the backdrop of a challenging environment as aforestated the Company delivered a competitively superior performance in the Paperboards Paper & Packaging segment. Strategic investments in pulp import substitution proactive capacity addition in Value Added Paperboard (VAP) segment process improvements and a cost-competitive fibre chain supported by effective go-to-market strategies helped the Company deliver robust growth in revenue and substantial improvement in profitability in paperboards and paper. The packaging business however witnessed a marked slowdown in demand especially in the FMCG and Liquor industries which weighed on its performance. The Company remains the clear leader in the VAP segment and continues to consolidate its preferred supplier position amongst leading end-use customers and brands. It is also a leading player in the eco-labelled products segment and premium recycled fibre based boards space.Recent capacity augmentation in VAP segment at Bhadrachalam mill is operating at full capacity delivering superior quality board which has been well accepted in the market.

In the Speciality Papers segment the recently commissioned Décor Papers machine at the Tribeni unit caters to a diverse range of world-class products and continues to be well accepted by discerning customers.  The Business continues to make structural interventions to reduce operating costs and dependence on imported pulp. Significant increase in in-house pulp production was achieved during the year through strategic interventions Industry 4.0 initiatives and improved wood mix. Capacity utilisation of Bleached Chemical Thermo Mechanical Pulp mill (BCTMP) at Bhadrachalam unit was further scaled up during the year. Innovations in the pulp mill have resulted in higher pulp production and improvement in pulp quality and yield. Initiatives such as bund plantation and plantation in core catchment area in Odisha (Malkangiri) will help in further reducing delivered cost of wood at the Bhadrachalam mill.

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "
TCS,https://www.tcs.com/data-quality-for-effective-digital-twins-in-oil-and-gas-arc,01 Jul 2020,"Effective digital twins need high-quality data in real time for common applications like predictive maintenance and optimizing the operational performance of equipment. An intelligent asset inspection program becomes an imperative for success. A digital twin, by definition, replicates attributes of a physical asset. Digital twins enable oil and gas companies to respond with fact-based decision support for the industry challenges, which can be particularly helpful considering the added adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A digital twin needs data for analytics, prediction, and automation. For a useful twin, the data must be of high quality, verified, and referenced. To operate in real time it needs current data and models. Predictive maintenance using data from a particular piece of equipment has been a key driver for adopting digital twins. Once a digital twin of a physical asset has been deployed, it is vital to keep it current to be effective for real-time decision support. "
TCS,https://www.tcs.com/building-a-winner-janssen-on-collaborating-on-connected-clinical-trial-platform,22 Oct 2019,"Clinical Research News - 22 Oct 2019 About four years ago, Bert Hartog, senior director, clinical innovation, at Janssen Pharmaceutica, realized that they had huge inefficiencies in clinical trials; were providing sup-optimal support for patients; and weren’t using new technologies the way they should. The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep. The product was recently awarded a European Innovations Award at SCOPE Europe. Read the complete article  here     "

K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/atmanirbharta-by-tata-motors-a-digital-campaign-vocalising-the-need-for-local/,"10 August, 2020","Tata Motors, India’s leading auto brand in association with WATConsult, the globally awarded hybrid digital agency from the house of Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN) India, today announced the launch of ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ – a digital campaign highlighting the existence of localisation in everything that we do. Designed and conceptualised by WATConsult, this campaign has been released ahead of the glorious occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day and emphasises on the meaning of ‘Atmanirbharta’ or self-reliance for individuals and the nation as a whole. Solidifying the brand’s stance for the ‘Vocal for Local’ initiative, the campaign is headlined by a video, which begins with a very young boy named Rohan shown seated in the rear seat of a Tata Nexon, while his father is driving him across the town. The son inquisitively asks his father, “Atmanirbharta kya hoti hai?” i.e. “What does Atmanirbharta mean?”. By showing a range of occupations to his son, the father makes him understand that Atmanirbharta means being self-reliant in all aspects of life and that it applies to people from all walks of life – be it a toymaker, bangle vendor, scientist or an engineer from ISRO, who sequentially appear in the film. The video ends with the display of Tata Motors’ New Forever range near a hoisted Indian flag, exemplifying the Company’s ability to deliver best in class products that cater to the local needs & tastes while evolving with time and being ever popular with customers. Adding to the above, ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ highlights that reaching the goal of being self-reliant is not an individualistic responsibility, but a collective one that falls on the shoulders of the entire country. Commenting on the launch of this campaign, Mr. Vivek Srivatsa, Head Marketing, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicle Business Unit said,  “Tata Motors has always been known as an automotive brand that is a flag bearer for products that caters to the Indian customer. Our cars are manufactured locally and provide world class Design, Safety and Driving pleasure to all. We are proud to be at the forefront of the conversation of being ‘Vocal for Local’. This campaign is our tribute to all the people and the homegrown businesses in India who make our country what it is. I am glad that both Tata Motors and WATConsult took this opportunity to emphasise on this message, and thereby in our own small way, we want to encourage the nation to understand a few aspects of being ‘Atmanirbhar’. Through the ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ campaign, we want to steer relevant conversation around the subject by sharing our perspective, while encouraging our customers and the country to work towards this overarching goal.” Talking about the campaign, Ms. Heeru Dingra, CEO, WATConsult added , “We are happy to have extended our relations with Tata Motors to curate a concept on a topic that is so relevant in today’s time. The idea was to promote and appreciate the concept of ‘Atmanirbharta’, which is becoming a necessary trait and a motto for our nation. While the animation makes the video more endearing, the narrative seamlessly portrays the potential that India drives, in terms of talent, power and various other aspects, in today’s age. With this video we are confident that we will be able to help each one of us understand the importance of being self-dependent along with respecting all the workers from different strata of life who are in their own way making our nation self-reliant.” This campaign’s concept takes an adaptive approach by using an animated video for the film as a substitution for a live action version, keeping into consideration the ongoing need for physical distancing. Initially launched in our national language – Hindi, this video will also be translated in English and multiple other regional languages to create a nationwide resonance.

Mahindra,https://www.mahindra.com/news-room/stories/pininfarina-partners-with-british-voltto-build-uk-s-largest-battery-plant,"05 Aug, 2020","UK-based battery manufacturer Britishvolt has partnered with Mahindra-owned Pininfarina, an Italian design company, to build a large-scale battery gigaplant. Pininfarina, the iconic Italian design firm, will partner with Britishvolt to build the United Kingdom’s first large-scale battery gigaplant. The project, situated in Bro Tathan, Wales, will help create the UK’s largest battery manufacturing facility, advancing the evolution of e-mobility. The Britishvolt gigaplant will be situated over 80+ acres of a green industrial park with a production capacity of up to 35 GWH. The focus for both companies is to design a facility that is both sensitive to its surroundings as well as welcoming to local residents. With an unrivalled heritage in the transport and automotive sectors – and collaborating with automotive brands such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Peugeot for decades – Pininfarina’s revolutionary designs will ensure that Britishvolt’sgigaplant not only fits the purpose but is also an elegant representation of the future of UK’s automotive industry. “Sustainable design is a necessary commitment to creating social and economic value for future generations,” Silvio Pietro Angori, CEO, Pininfarina, said about the partnership. “Britishvoltaims to become the world’s first zero-carbon battery manufacturer,” said OrralNadjari, CEO and Founder, Britishvolt, adding that it aligned perfectly with Pininfarina’s expertise in creating green, high-tech and innovative environment. “We have been able to draw on the expertise gained in the automotive world and apply this to architecture,” said Giovanni de Niederhäusern, Pininfarina’s Senior Vice President of Architecture.

Mahindra,https://www.mahindra.com/news-room/stories/rebalancing-the-balanced-scorecard,"05 Aug, 2020","Environmental resilience has proven to be an esoteric concept for most businesses. A recent McKinsey study indicates that even though many companies had considered Sustainability to be of prime importance, very few have a sustainability agenda integrated in their daily operations and strategies. There have been efforts to make organisational performance measurement holistic. The most successful one has been Robert Kaplan and David P Norton's the 'Balanced Scorecard', which achieves its balance by incorporating financial and non-financial parameters, outcomes and inputs, and both short-term and long-term actions across four perspectives — financial, customers, internal process, and learning and growth. The scorecard was developed when the climate conversation was just starting. It is, therefore, not surprising that climate action and social impact are conspicuous by their absence from parameters used to measure organisational success even in organisations that are renowned practitioners of the balanced scorecard. The McKinsey study estimates that sustainability actions can impact EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) by 70%. They could have an even bigger impact on enhancing resilience of an organisation. Energy efficiency and renewable energy projects reduce cost and carbon footprint. Heat recovery is a huge source of savings, natural resource efficiency and process improvement. Repurposing waste either results in saving cost or adding value, or both. Waste metal sold as scrap to a dealer gets much lower value than waste metal sold as input to a firm using an electric arc furnace. If waste steel is repurposed into another product — such as a transformer core — then the value obtained from it is many times higher compared to selling it as scrap. Food waste and sewage are both sources of natural gas and excellent fertiliser for crops. Water harnessing not only reduces risk of operation where water resources are scarce but also reduces pumping and sourcing costs in many situations. If done in a manner where water bodies are created inside the campus, it results in enhanced biodiversity and a pleasant work environment. Recycling wastewater has similar advantages. Paying for tanker water and flushing it down the drain or using it to water landscaped areas, is a criminal waste of a scarce resource and money. Diversification of a product portfolio by adding climate-friendly alternatives — for instance, addition of electric two-wheelers to the regular line-up opens up a new revenue stream — helps access a new breed of consumers and mitigates regulatory and market risk. Most businesses selling electrical equipment have remained relevant by totally revamping their product portfolio in the last five years with new products being incredibly more energy-efficient than the older ones.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.marutisuzuki.com/corporate/media/press-releases/2020/caring-for-the-environment-maruti-suzuki-offsets,"Jul 08, 2020","New Delhi :  Maruti Suzuki India Limited has transported over 670,000 cars through the Indian Railways in the past six years, witnessing a CAGR of over 18%. The first dispatch by double decker flexi-deck rakes took place in March 2014.  
  
           
			 


               
           
             
			
 The increased focus on using railways has helped the company offset nearly 3,000 MT of CO2 emissions. In addition, over 100 million litres of precious fossil fuel was saved, as the Company could avoid over 100,000 truck trips on the National Highways. 
 In FY 2019-20, over 1.78 lakh cars were dispatched by rail mode, a 15% increase over previous year. This accounts for nearly 12% of total sales of the Company in the year. 
 Explaining the importance of railways as one of the important modes of transport,  Mr Kenichi Ayukawa, Managing Director & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India said ,  “Considering the increasing volumes, our team felt the need for large scale logistics flow. We realised, that not only for expansion but also for risk mitigation we have to look beyond road mode logistics.” 
             

             
                       
             
 
           
 
 
    



 Background: 

 Maruti Suzuki, a pioneer in the use of railways to ferry finished vehicles, has come a long way from using a single deck converted rakes to deploying high speed, high capacity new design double deck rakes. The operations started with the use of Indian Railway wagons (converted from old passenger coaches). These single deck wagons were christened as New Modified Goods (NMG) with a capacity to handle 125 cars. 

 With growing volumes, there was a need for a shift to high capacity dedicated wagons. Accordingly, Indian Railways’ design arm RDSO (Research Design and Standard’s Organization) came up with a new design called BCACM after taking suggestions from several OEMs including Maruti Suzuki. The double decker rakes had a capacity of 265 cars (over 100% increase in carrying capacity). Since its inception, over 140,000 cars have been dispatched through these rakes. 

 As volumes further increased, a next generation high capacity, high speed wagon design was required to tide over the constraints of BCACM design rakes (limited models due to fixed middle deck). Based on the inputs from Maruti Suzuki and others, RDSO developed a new design Auto-wagon called BCACBM. Concept Design was ready in February 2011. Prototype Wagons were got fabricated by Maruti Suzuki and finally they were approved by RDSO for manufacturing. 

 The new design BCACBM rakes were more flexible as all models could be accommodated. The capacity increased by 20% from 265 cars to 318 cars. Moreover, these rakes were designed to be operated at a speed limit of 95 Km/hr, highest for any goods train in India. Till date 27 such high capacity rakes have been inducted by Maruti Suzuki and its service providers for dispatch of Maruti Suzuki cars. 

 Maruti Suzuki is the first auto manufacturer in the country to obtain Automobile Freight Train Operator (AFTO) license. This allows private firms to fabricate and operate high speed, high capacity auto-wagon rakes on the Indian Railway’s network. 

 At present, Maruti Suzuki utilises five loading terminals (Gurgaon, Farukhnagar, Kathuwas, Patli and Detroj) and 13 destination terminals (Bangalore, Nagpur, Mumbai, Guwahati, Mundra Port, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, NCR, Siliguri and Agartala). With the addition of Agartala, the reach of rail mode has now been extended to far North East. It has helped to reduce the transportation time to these states by nearly half.

financial results for the period April-June, FY 2020-21 (Quarter 1). 

 Owing to the global pandemic of COVID-19, it was an unprecedented quarter in the Company’s history
wherein a large part of the quarter had zero production and zero sales in compliance with a lockdown
stipulated by the government. Production and sales started in a very small way in the month of May. The
Company’s first priority was the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees and associates across the
value chain including its customers. Hence with carefully designed safety protocols, which went far
beyond compliance levels, the production in the whole Quarter was equivalent to just about two weeks’
of regular working. The results have to be viewed in this context. 

 Highlights: Quarter 1 (April-June), FY 2020-21 

 The Company sold a total of 76,599 vehicles during the Quarter. Sales in the domestic market stood at
67,027 units. Exports were at 9,572 units. 

 During the Quarter, the Company registered Net Sales of INR 36,775 million. 

 The Company made a Net Loss of INR 2,494 million in the Quarter. It was partially off-set by lower
operating expenses and higher fair-value gain on the invested surplus.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.marutisuzuki.com/corporate/media/press-releases/2020/maruti-suzuki-delivering-sustainable-growth-through-inclusive-approach,"Aug 04, 2020","New Delhi :  Maruti Suzuki India Limited today released its Annual Integrated Report for the financial year 2019-20. In addition to this, the Company has also highlighted its contribution to the various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

 Addressing stakeholders through this report Mr. R C Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Limited , said  “The COVID-19 epidemic has given your Company, as well as its vendors and dealers, an opportunity to review all systems of working and become more efficient and competitive. Thus, while we are going through difficult days, I believe we will all emerge stronger and fitter in the future.” 
  
           
			 


               
           
             
			
 On the current market situation  Mr. Bhargava added ,  “The market, at present, seems to favour smaller hatchbacks and petrol and CNG cars. Fortunately, we are well placed for such products.” 

 On Company’s approach towards Human Resources Mr Bhargava added ,  “The well-knit team of employees continues to the greatest strength of your Company. Over decades they have shown that when all employees of a company work unitedly for its growth and prosperity, a win-win situation is created for everyone. The competitiveness of the Company remains very high and it is able to meet and overcome all challenges. The full potential of employees, including the blue-collar workers, is enabled to develop fully under this form of management.” 

 Sharing optimism he concluded ,  “I look to the future with a great deal of optimism. Many new opportunities are likely to open as the world adjusts to the post COVID-19 scene. The government has always been very supportive of manufacturing and I expect conditions for increasing our competitiveness and growth will continue to get better in the coming year.” 

 Addressing stakeholders through this report, Mr. Kenichi Ayukawa, Managing Director & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Limited  said,  “India’s long-term economic prospects are promising which augur well for the automobile business. Experience from the global financial crisis suggests that the Indian economy is quite resilient, and it may not be too far to think that the Indian economy may recover relatively faster this time as well. The Company is making all-round efforts to both participate and drive this recovery.” 

             

             
                       
             
 
           
 
 
    

 Mr Ayukawa explained Company’s approach to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic ,  “This crisis may change our businesses and society in some ways. This may require careful analysis of the changed world and accordingly, the strategy, resources and structure need to be realigned. This crisis may lead to the emergence of new opportunities, skill sets and technological solutions, and we have to be quick in adapting to the requirements of the changed world. I firmly believe in ‘the survival of fittest’. The other important lesson this crisis has taught, is that the business environment has become far more dynamic and interconnected and far less predictable than before. At a time when the automobile industry is witnessing a once-in-a-century transformation across the world, events like COVID-19 further increase the complexity of business. We are fortunate to have support of our parent, Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) which has completed 100 years in March this year.” 

 On the technology front Mr. Ayukawa added ,  “One of the priorities of the world is to reduce carbon footprint and India also needs to reduce its oil imports. Your Company is strongly committed to this direction. In the last 15 years, the Company has reduced carbon emissions of its fleet by 20%. As measured by the CAFÉ regulation, your Company’s fleet has the least CO2 emission per vehicle among all car manufacturers in India. The Company is going further and following a philosophy of reducing carbon footprint with every new model introduction. For further reduction to meet the future CO2 targets, the Company is adopting a mix of powertrain technologies based on electrification and CNG. The Company is making efforts to electrify its powertrain, ranging from smart hybrids to strong hybrids to electric vehicles. The partnership between Suzuki Motor Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation will help the Company to gain access to hybrid technology. SMC is not only providing its support for requisite technology, but also partnering to putting up India’s first Lithium ion cell and battery manufacturing facility.”

HCL_Tech,https://www.hcltech.com/press-releases/press-releases-business/hcl-technologies-covid-19-status-update,"Mar 30, 2020      ","Noida, India, March, 30, 2020  – HCL Technologies Ltd (HCL) has been monitoring the Covid-19 outbreak since late January and had invoked its Business Continuity Plan and Risk Management Framework quite early to minimize the impact on its employees and clients. The situation arising out of this outbreak and its rapid spread across the world is unprecedented and is extremely dynamic. The economic impact is visible with varying degrees of intensity across multiple countries where we operate. HCL has had a well-defined and structured pandemic policy in place which is resilient, pragmatic and accords paramount importance to employee safety & health and client commitments. We are actively engaged with our clients and have executed the client-specific and HCL internal operations-centric Business Continuity Plan that ensures continuity in delivering to our client and employee commitments. HCL is constantly reviewing the situation at hand with utmost priority and fully complying with all government advisories and recommendations. Given the extended nature of this situation, we have looked at ensuring that we put in medium-term sustainable measures in place to ensure continuity of all our operations and client deliverables. We have been successful in achieving this as of today. A large number of our clients have expressed their deep appreciation of our efforts and speed at which we have been able to achieve the current state. As of today,  76%  of our India-based employees and  92%  of our employees in other geographies are enabled to work from home. In certain geographies, a limited set of our employees are working from our offices, wherever it is permissible by the government and local authorities. It is noteworthy that we have not witnessed any outages or major disruption in operations with this newer format of work from home delivery. We would like to use this opportunity to thank our clients, industry bodies and government officials who have been very supportive in our efforts so far. Likely Impact on business While the impact on this quarter’s numbers is yet to be quantified, we don’t expect it to be significant. Our exposure to the more impacted verticals are not significant. Booking during this quarter has largely been on track as significant part of closures happened in January. Our business model is a healthy mix of recurring product revenues, managed services and discretionary spend led professional services. From a vertical perspective, our exposure to verticals like Oil & Gas, Travel & Hospitality, High-End Retail is in single digits. We recognize our investments in risk management systems and processes over the last several years are helping us to minimize the short-term impact and to be adequately prepared for the medium term, if it gets worse. We are also confident our business model will help us to emerge stronger in the longer term as it has been built for resilience during tough times. Our wishes of safety and best of health to everyone out there and we hope and pray for the earliest end to the crisis. Keep a safe distance.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/reskill-restart-innovative-workforce.html,22 Jul 2020,"Consortium led by Infosys, comprised of pymetrics, Merit America, Per Scholas, Revature, and Woz Enterprise, will leverage Infosys Wingspan to create a free, online platform, connecting employees and employers, and also provide training for job-seekers New York – July 22, 2020 Infosys  (NYSE: INFY), a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, today announced a consortium in partnership with pymetrics – the leader in fair talent matching – that brings together training partners Merit America, Per Scholas, Revature, and Woz Enterprise. The consortium will leverage Infosys Wingspan and pymetrics’ AI-based talent-matching platform to meet the reskilling and employment needs raised by the COVID-19 crisis in America. Reskill and Restart —powered by Infosys Wingspan—takes job seekers on a guided journey, beginning with aptitude and skills assessment, followed by curated job-specific skills training, and culminating in matching them with available positions. The consortium of partners has built new pathways for talent to transition from traditional jobs across various industries and workstreams to digital and operations jobs of the future. It also enables employers who are scaling up to review the available talent pool for the right match and hire them while they undergo rapid and job-specific reskilling on this integrated multi-stakeholder platform. “Infosys has always invested in and promoted lifelong learning, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made radical reskilling an even more urgent priority for job seekers and employers alike. We are excited to partner with leaders in the skills assessment, training, and apprenticeship space to leverage our Wingspan platform and provide opportunities for Americans to grow their skills and find relevant employment opportunities,” said  Ravi Kumar, President, Infosys . “We are intensely focused on creating job opportunities in the U.S., and this solution demonstrates our broader commitment to American workers and the U.S. economy.” “Jobs held by women and people of color have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and pymetrics sees this coalition as an opportunity to radically level the playing field for getting these communities back to work,” said  Frida Polli, PhD, CEO and co-founder, pymetrics . “Our talent matching engine uncovers individuals’ cognitive, emotional, and social aptitudes, reveals opportunities for skill enhancement via our integration with Burning Glass, and marries that understanding with personalized recommendations for training and jobs. The approach is unlike any other on the market today because it focuses on potential, not pedigree, and we believe it can be instrumental in helping these displaced and disadvantaged employees get back to work.” ""The Revature family is honored to invest in people and communities around the U.S. in partnership with the Infosys Reskill and Restart program. Creating opportunity for all to participate in the most vibrant parts of our economy should be our collective priority as a nation,” said  Ashwin Bharath, CEO, Revature . “We are confident that our world-class training, utilized by blue-chip companies throughout the U.S., will provide life-changing professional opportunities for these individuals."" “Skills training organizations will be key to enabling businesses to recover from the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said  Plinio Ayala, CEO, Per Scholas . “It is critically important that job seekers have the resources they need to develop the in-demand skills necessary to compete in the post-COVID digital economy. Per Scholas’ partnership with Infosys will provide employees a unique platform to build these skills, as well as a steady pipeline of talent for employers.” “Woz Enterprise has been working closely with partners like Infosys to find innovative ways to rethink how training can be done. To put Americans back to work we need to provide solutions that include rapid upskilling for those who want a technology job but have never worked in technology before,” said  Jacob Mayhew, CEO, Woz Enterprise, a division of Woz U . “This is at the heart of the apprenticeship programs and training solutions we are developing to ensure we are in lock-step with business needs and are fulfilling our core mission of creating a swiftly evolving and essential technology workforce pipeline that not only puts people back to work, but provides a much more diverse population of talent than ever before.” “In the past few months, tens of millions of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. Today’s challenge
          is about more than getting Americans back to work: it’s about creating pathways to higher-paying, more resilient careers, in order to build a more equitable future as the economy recovers,” said  Connor Diemand-Yauman, co-CEO, Merit America . “Merit America prepares low-wage Americans for skilled careers at scale, and we’re thrilled to see Infosys step up in this time of need. Through our partnership, we hope to prepare low-income adults for recession-resilient careers aligned to employer demand.” Infosys’ Wingspan platform will leverage the pymetrics AI-based talent-matching platform, which delivers native aptitude assessment and skills gap analysis via Burning Glass, as well as the training material from the consortium partners, alongside Infosys’ own digital programs and courses to provide a comprehensive experience for job seekers. The courses provided will allow COVID-19 impacted job seekers to find and gain skills that are in demand in today’s job market. The platform will also allow American companies, in any industry, to find and hire talent as well as explore reskilling opportunities for their current workforce.

We are grateful to the state for including us in this important initiative.” “We have been asking Rhode Islanders to keep a diary of who they come into contact with each day,” said  Governor Raimondo . “Especially now, as we begin the process of reopening our state, this type of contact tracing is critical to identifying and slowing the spread of the virus. Thanks to the generous work of our partners at Infosys, we now have a tool at our fingertips to do just that.

We are thankful to Narayana Health City for their partnership and the thoughtfulness of this initiative.” Dr. Devi Shetty, Chairman and Executive Director, Narayana Health,  said, “We are pleased to partner with Infosys Foundation to open this 100-room quarantine facility for underprivileged patients. Providing safe-spaces, with proper medical care to enable patients to isolate themselves, will play a big role in India’s fight against COVID-19, and we thank Infosys Foundation for their support in this endeavor.” Established in 1996, the Infosys Foundation supports programs in the areas of education, rural development, healthcare, arts and culture, and destitute care.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.tatasteel.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/india/2020/tata-steel-foundation-observes-international-day-of-the-world-s-indigenous-peoples/," August 09, 2020","~ Resilience of indigenous people to current pandemic takes centre stage in a webinar ~ On  International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples  today, Tata Steel Foundation (TSF) hosted a webinar to honour the strength, resilience, dignity, and pride of indigenous peoples. Experts from diverse backgrounds came together to discuss the innovative ways in which the indigenous communities continue demonstrating resilience and strength in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr Meenakshi Munda, Social Scientist and Writer, and Naresh Deogam, Vice President, Ho Mahasabha, Chaibasa, participated as panelists and shared insights and good practices with the audience to highlight how the preservation and promotion of indigenous peoples’ traditional knowledge and practices can be leveraged further during this pandemic.  Naresh Deogam said: “ In tribal cultures, when someone enters our house, we wash the hand of people with turmeric water as it acts like an antiseptic. Practices like these have kept our homes safe and such cultures have so much relevance today. ”  Dr Munda expressed that there are a lot of practices that exists in the tribal communities that the world overlooks. “ Interestingly, most of the world’s oldest and scientific practices lie with them. A number of tribal communities have made masks of sal leaves and many have stuck down their villages. They understand social distancing in a better manner because it has been a practice in their communities to lock themselves up when a health crisis happens, ” she opined.    Eminent folk singer and Padma Shri recipient Mukund Nayak also sent his wishes through a video message marking the launch of ‘Vishwaas’, the first single from Rhythms of the Earth (ROTE), which is an ensemble of tribal music across India and has been curated by TSF. This musical celebration of the many wonderful women, men and children from the tribes of the country is a vote of confidence in a way of life which has never distinguished between our planet and its people, and rejoices all that can be learnt from the tribes of the world who are with the Company and the Foundation on the Samvaad (the annual tribal conclave hosted by Tata Steel) journey.   Rhythms of the Earth (ROTE), that germinated on the stage of Samvaad, brings together more than 90 musicians from over 16 tribes and 6 states. In February 2018, ROTE performed at National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai and the same year in November witnessed a music collaboration with Bickram Ghosh and Purbayan Chatterjee. In November 2019, ROTE’s traditional music fused with Swarathma’s contemporary beats and brought alive a musical symphony.  “ The tribal communities have steadfast confidence in their traditional identity, unshakable faith in harmony that nature teaches us and conviction that human beings can and need to balance the effects on the environment and community. This song reiterates our confidence and our willingness to learn from their rich way of life, ” said Sourav Roy, Chief CSR, Tata Steel.   A diverse audience joined the webinar and interacted with the panelists. In its journey of understanding and ushering a shared context with the indigenous communities across its operational locations, Tata Steel has been fortunate to closely associate with their culture and practices that make them so unique and sublime.   Visit the link  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw2D2C13BM0  to view ‘Vishwaas’, the first single from ‘Rhythms of the Earth’.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.tatasteel.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/india/2020/tata-steel-introduces-the-first-ever-fibre-reinforced-polymer-quarantine-units-in-india/," June 24, 2020","~ Collaboration within Tata Group companies to enable an agile response to fight the pandemic ~ The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a ramp up of our country’s healthcare infrastructure. To aid the frontline healthcare professionals in their efforts, Tata Steel along with other Tata Group companies including Tata Projects and Tata Consulting Engineers have demonstrated both agility and collaborative spirit by working together on a 500-bed Greenfield hospital project being developed over a 5-acre site in Kasargod in Kerala. With design specifications and inputs from Tata Projects and Tata Consulting Engineers, Tata Steel is supplying a range of modular pre-fabricated Completely Built Units (CBUs) to be used primarily as quarantine and isolation cabins, rest rooms, canteens and other service units within the hospital. These pre-fabricated units are being produced by Tata Steel’s brand Nest-In, its Tubes Division and its New Materials Business in collaboration with eight manufacturing partners across the country. Besides steel, Tata Steel is using Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) to manufacture quarantine units for the first time in India. FRP is positioned as a new-age alternative building material that has compelling pros that makes it a viable mass-production solution for the future. Commenting on this unique project and successful use of FRP in the production of quarantine units,  Dr Debashish Bhattacharjee, Vice President, Technology & New Materials Business, Tata Steel , said: “ While our Nest-In business had experience of manufacturing modular steel enclosures, we innovatively made use of FRP material in this project. FRP sandwich sheets were used for the walls and roof. The doors were also made of FRP, which is a more durable material than traditional options. The design was optimised to keep the price point similar to that of an all-steel unit. New Materials Business, together with Nest-In and with professional support from the Product Application Group and Logistics team, provided key support to meet Tata Steel’s commitment for timely supply of COVID-19 cabins to Kasargod. ” Each 400m 2  quarantine unit can accommodate five beds and one washroom. The FRP units are made using Tata Structura hollow sections with FRP walls and roof panels. They come with factory-fitted electrical and plumbing systems as well. The FRP units offer several benefits such as being lightweight, a high strength to weight ratio and being easier and cheaper to transport. Moreover, FRP is completely corrosion-resistant and weatherproof, while offering maintenance-free service life. “ Tata Steel is working to create a tangible impact towards combating the COVID-19 crisis through our expertise and specialty products by creating customised solutions for the healthcare sector. Creating solutions powered by innovation and collaboration is at the core to combat the crisis, ” said  T. V. Srinivas Shenoy, Chief, New Materials Business, Tata Steel . Nest-In, part of Tata Steel’s Services & Solutions portfolio, has also enabled smooth manufacturing and timely supply of quarantine and isolation cabins across the country. The Company is in discussions with health authorities to explore the possibility of setting up Nest-In Covid-19 units across different parts of India. “ The quarantine and isolation cabins designed and manufactured by Nest-In will be a key aspect of our efforts to provide the best physical infrastructure to augment the larger efforts undertaken to treat and contain COVID-19. Through innovation and collaboration, our expert professionals are committed to creating solutions for all sectors needing support to contain the spread of the pandemic, ” said  P. Anand, Chief, Services & Solutions, Tata Steel . Tata Group has always remained committed to socially relevant initiatives and the recent attention to synergy, simplification and scale is encouraging many collaborations within the group. This project with quarantine units is one such initiative and the usage of FRP further drives Tata Steel’s commitment to an innovative and sustainable future with materials beyond steel.

Consequently, global steel demand is expected to be sharply lower in 2020 before a meaningful recovery in 2021. Government of India imposed a stringent nationwide lockdown with effect from 25 th  March 2020 severely impacting manufacturing activities. Steel and Mining were exempt from the lockdown measures, albeit subject to certain guidelines. However, steel demand was affected as key steel consuming sectors struggled to operate amidst weakening economic activities, working capital constraints, shortage of manpower and logistical issues. In Europe, the outbreak of Covid-19 has further accentuated the sustained weak steel demand. Share of steel imports to total consumption in EU continues to remain at elevated levels which is a cause of concern. After witnessing a decline in steel demand growth in 2019, EU expects a steel demand recovery only in 2021. At Tata Steel, our first and foremost priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are focused on running operations safely and efficiently to service our customers. We are also focused on liquidity management to face any future disruption in business conditions.   With the phased removal of the lockdown restrictions in India, our upstream steel making operations have been ramped up and are currently operating at about 80% utilization levels. Our downstream units have reopened and are steadily ramping up. There are early signs of a recovery in steel demand on the back of increased spending on infrastructure projects as well as rural demand. In Europe, Tata Steel Europe continues to operate at about 70% utilization level. Key steel consuming sectors such as automotive and construction sector continue to be adversely affected, though demand for packaging material has seen a sharp upsurge. Key Operating and Financial Highlights of full year and the quarter: Indian operations: European operations: Key corporate developments: Management Comments:  Mr. T V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director:  “FY20 has been a challenging year.  The Indian economy slowed down in the first half with key steel consuming sectors like automotive contracting sharply. While the economy began recovering in the second half, the outbreak of Covid-19 in end March led to unprecedented disruption and heightened economic uncertainty. We have recalibrated our operations in line with the evolving business environment and are focused on conserving cash while actively de-risking the business.  While deliveries in India were marred by the nationwide lockdown in late March 2020, margins improved on the back of stronger performance in the early part of the quarter. Both our acquisitions, Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products continue to deliver improvements in operating KPIs which has translated into better profitability. Tata Steel Europe showed a turnaround in performance with positive EBITDA for the quarter. While there will be a sharp drop in volumes in 1QFY21, we are seeing early signs of recovery and remain poised to leverage our position on normalization of business conditions.” Mr. Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO: “Given the heightened uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are focused on conserving cash and ensuring adequate liquidity to face potential disruptions in the operating environment. We have pivoted business decisions on cashflows and successfully driven cash neutrality in our operations by reducing spend, managing working capital and curtailing capital expenditure. We also raised additional funds of Rs.4,900 crores to build a contingency buffer. Our liquidity at the end of the year remained robust at Rs.17,745 crores including cash and cash equivalents of Rs.11,549 crores. In Q4FY20, our India operations reported a 11%QoQ improvement in EBITDA to Rs.4,568 crores for the quarter, which is an EBIDTA margin of 23.4%. Tata Steel Standalone EBITDA margin was higher at 25.8%. Tata Steel BSL EBITDA improved to Rs.775 crores while Tata Steel LP increased to Rs.132 crores. Tata Steel Europe performance reported an EBITDA of Rs.65 crores compared to a loss of Rs.956 crores in 3QFY19. All this led to a 28%QoQ improvement in our consolidated EBITDA to Rs.4,669 crores.” Disclaimer: Statements in this press release describing the Company’s performance may be “forward looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws and regulations.

Project Aakansha comes up with a unique initiative in the area of education, The project focuses to support the PVTG (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group) who are considered as the extremely backward tribes and are on the verge of extinction. The people of these tribes have their education level close to 'NIL'. With an objective to make this tribe survive and develop the first and foremost need was assessed to be the education of their children. In 2011, Project Akanksha was initiated by taking 10 children and getting them admitted into residential schools. Every year this number has been increased and many more schools have been roped in to take children into their fold. Currently there are 262 students from Sabar, Birhor and Paharia tribes who are the 3 prominent PVTGs in the vicinity of the Tata Steel’s manufacturing base of Jamshedpur. These children are enrolled in 6 different residential schools. For the knowledge of all, it is worth mentioning here that they are first generation learners. The elders from their villages, the parents of children in particular, are taken to the residential schools from time to time so that they can interact and encourage their children to yearn for higher objectives in their lives. This year the first batch of 4 children appeared for the JAC (Jharkhand Academic Council) Board Matriculation Examination. Authorities involved with the Aakansha project were keeping their fingers crossed for the results. All four students, who did not leave any stone unturned, passed their exams with flying colours.  With this rare achievement, entire Tata Steel family is jubilant about the success of these young ones. The names and results of these students are: 3 students from Carmel School, Chakradharpur (West Singhbhum): 1 student from Siddhu Kanu Shiksha Niketan School, Dimna (East Singhbhum)  Tata Steel family hopes for still better results next year when many more children of these PVTG families will take the board exams. Now these children will be shifted to another residential school for their plus two education and wish them all the luck.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.tatasteel.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/india/2020/tata-steel-foundation-ensures-healthcare-access-for-expectant-mothers/," May 07, 2020","While the world is gradually coming to terms with​the novel coronavirus, there are still many uncertainties. This is contributing to the anxiety of expectant mothers. In this context, the ​Tata Steel Foundation (TSF) has taken the initiative to provide support to pregnant women  in the villages adjacent to Kalinganagar. The local unit of TSF has prepared an action plan​ ​to identify and ​provide solutions to the​ various problems faced by the expectant mothers ​during the lockdown period in the ​Sukinda and Danagadi blocks. With the help of​Accredited Social Health Activists ​(​ASHA)​, a database of expectant mothers in the area has been created. Along with the team, continuous tracking is being carried out to ensure that issues before and after delivery are taken care of.  Babita Mohanta, an expectant mother residing at Salijanga Gram Panchayat, says: ​“I was in pain and it was getting worse. I realised that I needed to urgently see a doctor. I contacted the local ASHA​Didi and she, along with the Tata Steel's Corporate Social Responsibility team, arranged an ambulance for me.”  A​part from ​creating awareness and disseminating information to dispel doubts and fears, efforts are being made to​ improve communication between health providers and pregnant women. This has helped increase the likelihood of positive outcomes. Daily follow-ups between ASHA workers and the expectant mothers are being conducted by the Health Team of TSF. Steps are also being taken to prepare expectant mothers for the delivery a week before the expected date.    ` Jaymani Hansdah, a 29-year old ASHA worker from Salijanga Gram Panchayat working with the TSF’s Health Team, says: ​“​Most people were initially apprehensive about how to deal with the situation. We went door-to-door and created awareness and emphasised on the need to not panic. A week before delivery, we keep ourselves ready by alerting the Hospital and Ambulance.​”  A​p​art from this, regular interactions with doctors are being facilitated through video and phone calls. TSF’s​In-house doctors are coordinating with doctors of the local Community Health Centre (CHC) and sharing the history of the patients to ensure proper treatment and care for them. ​Regular interactions are organised post-delivery to ensure that vaccinations are given to newborns on time. Since the lockdown due to COVID-19, TSF has been able to facilitate safe deliveries for 24 pregnant women. There remain approximately 88 expectant mothers who have been identified for delivery by end-May.  “​Amid this pandemic, there are families who are welcoming babies. However, due to the very nature of the virus, it is imperative that everyone who is dealing with an expectant mother is aware of the basic dos and don’ts. W​e are tracking ladies​who are in advanced stage of pregnancy during the lockdown as they are at a higher risk. ​Tracking of expectant mothers is helping us in taking preventive measures, detect risks in a timely fashion, reduce complications and address health inequalities.” said Mr Allen Jose​p​h, Head of the CSR Unit of Tata Steel, Kalinganagar."

This is the third time the steel maker has been accorded this special recognition for its industry leading and progressive HR practices. Tata Steel is the only company from the manufacturing sector in the 2020 list. The 2020 edition of the ‘Business Today Best Companies to Work For’ survey was conducted with an aim to understand perceptions and aspirations of India's massive workforce across several industries. The survey offers an insight into how industries at large and in specific sectors can align their employer brands to aspirations and thoughts of their workforce. The key parameters that were captured and measured to make it to this coveted list include fairness and objectivity (performance and how conflicts are managed), learning opportunities, work-life balance and flexibility, compensation and benefits, career growth path, communication, job security and company stability, challenging work opportunities, work environment, culture of inclusion, culture of innovation and leadership's commitment to business. Suresh Dutt Tripathi, Vice President, HRM, Tata Steel  said:  “Tata Steels commitment to create the best work environment has been the cornerstone of its success since its inception. Several industrial HR practices that have now become a norm across all sectors can be traced back to Tata Steel’s modest beginnings more than a century ago. This latest recognition from Business Today as the ‘Best Company to Work For’ honours the time-tested workplace traditions of Tata Steel with a modern outlook & futuristic mindset and we are proud to be featured amongst the best employers in India.” When it comes to people, Tata Steel believes that there is no limit to the value which people can bring to the table if they are provided with the right opportunities for learning, the right culture to empower and the right career opportunities. The Company has strong focus on development and practices such as open job postings which enable employees to move across functions and ‘own their career’. The focused leadership development interventions have enabled the organisation to have more than 90% of its top leaders to be home grown.

In view of the lockdown and social distancing norms, the gesture of homage was performed digitally by employees of the Company. On the occasion, a webinar on the ‘ Role of Mining in Achieving a 5 trillion Economy ’ by S. K. Adhikari, Chief Mining Geologist, Indian Bureau of Mines, Government of India, was organised. The Company also hosted an e-exhibition titled ‘Rock Show’ and a podcast on the life and achievements of P. N. Bose. D. B. Sundara Ramam, Vice President (Raw Materials), Tata Steel, remarked:  “ P N Bose was an outstanding Geologist. His geological findings have been instrumental in shaping the industrial journey of India.” R Rabi Prasad, President, Tata Workers` Union, in his message said:   “During this crisis of Coronavirus, it is great that we are using digital media to remember our heroes. On the birth anniversary of P N Bose, I would like to remember and thank him for his contribution to not only Tata Steel but also Jamshedpur and the entire   Nation. He will always remain in our hearts.” Born on May 12, 1855 in a remote village of Gaipur, in 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, geologist P N Bose graduated in Science from London University and passed out from the Royal School of Mines in 1878. During his years as geologist, he discovered iron ore mines in Dhulli and Rajhara in Madhya Pradesh. The most outstanding achievement of his life was the discovery of iron ore deposits in the hills of Gorumahisani in the state of Mayurbhanj. Following the discovery, P N Bose wrote a letter to J N Tata (Founder of Tata Steel) on February 24, 1904 which led to the establishment of Tata Iron and Steel Company at Sakchi on August 26, 1907. P N Bose has several firsts to his credit. He was the first Indian graduate in science from a British University; first to discover petroleum in Assam; first to set up a soap factory in India and also the first to introduce micro sections as an aid to petrological work. He was also the first Indian to hold a graded position in the Geological Survey of India where he served with distinction. As a man of science, he had constantly taken up the cause of technical education in the country. His efforts also catalysed the foundation of the Bengal Technical Institute which is better known as the Jadavpur University today of which Bose was the first honorary Principal.

This is a first-of-its-kind smart warehouse for onions developed with scientific backing and latest innovation and technology. The lack of scientific storage practices, non-standard designs and poor quality of material used for onion storage leads to over 40% loss of the produce inside the warehouse. With unpredictable weather and climate changes and the recent challenges of transport and movement, farmers face multiple challenges with respect to storage and maintaining a healthy shelf life for their produce. Over the years, the farmers have suffered losses in quality and quantity of their produce, as the onion industry lacks proper storage facilities. Anand, Chief, Services & Solutions, Tata Steel  said: “ We strongly believe achieving self-reliance and self-sustainability in agriculture is critical to making India atmanirbhar. Inspired by this mission, our expert professionals are developing customised solutions for the agriculture sector. Climate change and environmental conditions affect the shelf-life of the farmers produce and lack of proper storage facilities lead to huge losses. We understood the problem here and our teams crafted a solution that is long-term and practical. We are committed to creating innovative products and solutions for our customers and enable a better tomorrow.” Given that the agricultural sector supports 70% of India’s population and contributes to 50% of the GDP, the government is rapidly investing in Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). Tata Steel’s Innovent identified this white space in the market to build solutions in agri-infrastructure. Taking a step forward to achieve this objective and support the backbone of the Indian economy, Tata Steel’s Nest-In and Innovent teams have developed Agronest, a smart warehouse solution with a unique structural design that maximises air flow, is spacious thus making it conducive for longer and safer storage of onions, and provides a cost-effective environment control to ensure minimal wastage. The warehouse has sensors installed for monitoring temperature, humidity and gas, thereby enabling early detection of spoilage of the produce. Components from 4 major Tata Steel brands - Tata Structura, Tata Tiscon, Tata Wiron and coated sheets from Tata Steel BSL, have been used in the solution, promising quality and structural longevity to the customers. About Innovent Innovation is the backbone for any company striving to compete in today’s business world.

Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.tatasteel.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/india/2020/tata-shaktee-completes-its-20-year-journey-as-the-leader-in-india-s-gc-roof-market/," August 06, 2020","~ Launched in 2000 as the first national galvanized corrugated roof brand in India ~ ~ Leads with a 34% share in the organized GC roof market in the country ~ ~ Established as a household brand name for roofing structures in rural India ~ Tata Shaktee, the leader in India’s galvanized corrugated (GC) roof market, completes its glorious two-decade-long journey this year. Introduced as an affordable and credible alternative to reinforced cement concrete (RCC) roof in 2000, Tata Shaktee today commands a third of India’s highly competitive GC roof market with its enviable reach into the country’s rural market.  Since its launch, Tata Shaktee has also emerged as the brand that changed the face of the corrugated sheet category in India. Today, as the undisputed market leader, Tata Shaktee owes its success to innovative products and services, continuous nurturing of the distribution channel, and sharply-focused and effective brand communication. Sanjay S. Sahni, Chief of Marketing & Sales (Branded Products & Retail), Tata Steel, said:  “Since its launch two decades ago, Tata Shaktee has been a revolutionary idea for several reasons. It is among the first retail brands from Tata Steel that succeeded in bringing a professional structure to the highly unorganized GC roof market in India and make it customer friendly. By the sheer persuasion of its superior quality and transparent pricing, today Tata Shaktee is known as the brand that put a roof on rural India and stands as an epitome of trust. We expect to continue on this successful journey through product and pricing innovation and most importantly keeping the culture of customer satisfaction ahead of everything else.” The recently introduced thinner sizes ranging between 0.20 and 0.28 mm has helped Tata Shaktee create new markets by offering the best-in-class products made affordable to a wider range of consumers, particularly in rural India. Further, through Tata Shaktee’s Roof Junction Service, consumers also get ready to use fully-fabricated roofs made by skilled hands and two follow-up maintenance inspections in the first year of installation. Additionally, the Company also provides a two-year warranty against leakage. Further, product innovations like WAMA was launched to cater to the demand for vertical applications for walling and fencing needs. Long Length Tata Shaktee GC Sheets were also launched to further provide SKUs for lengths up to 24 feet. The Roof Building basket is completed by the Range of Branded Accessories provided by the Company that includes Ridges and Gutters. As the country’s first GC sheet brand, Tata Shaktee enjoys several consumer-centric firsts to its credit including the first one to print the sheet thickness and the zinc coating in grams per square meter (GSM) on the sheet. It additionally ensured that all the sheets had a uniform 120 GSM zinc coating. Tata Shaktee was the also the first branded RCC product to introduce the concept of Recommended Consumer Price (RCP) that allowed the manufacturer to set the price at which a product could be sold to a customer. This simple act eliminated price cheating and ensured that there could be no black marketing caused by artificial shortages. Tata Shaktee was also the first to introduce 910 mm and 1220 mm sheets to provide greater coverage and thus more value. Being wider than the standard 800 mm GC sheets, a fewer number of GC sheets are required to cover the same area. This resulted in fewer overlaps, a lesser number of joints, and reduced wastage. Over the last two decades, Tata Shaktee has also emerged as a multi-award bagger under several consumer and industry categories including being the only Superbrand in the GC roof market in India. The brand has won many RMAI awards, three WOW awards and two ET Champions of Rural Marketing Award for its outstanding marketing campaigns. Tata Shaktee is manufactured in the Company’s iconic Jamshedpur steel plant which has been bestowed with the Prime Minister’s trophy for Best Performing Integrated Steel Plant in India for several years. In 2020, the iconic brand is celebrating a glorious journey of  ‘Garv ke 20 Saal’  with aspirations to enable rural India to ‘Live with Pride’ for many more years to come.

                 2020","We are moving towards a technology driven economy wherein meeting the ever-growing power demands of India’s industrial cities is one of the challenging tasks. And, making this possible to achieve is Tata Power’s efficient transmission and distribution system which has revitalised the distribution sector by continuously upgrading the technology. Tata Power’s unique 'Islanding System' has over the years ensured an uninterrupted and reliable supply of power in Mumbai. In case of a grid failure, the Islanding System ensures uninterrupted power supply within the city limits. In case of a breakdown in the Western Regional Power Grid, Tata Power's system is automatically isolated from the rest of the grid. It ensures that our generating units continue to function. All essential services are assured continuity of power supply. Being an early adopter of technological innovations, Tata Power offers various ‘new-age’ services such as Microsoft Kaizala app, Know Your Electricity Consumption (KYEC) app, Smart Meter Reading Device app, GIS based location tracking for technicians and WI-Fi meter reading device. While Kaizala offers one click solutions for consumers to register complaint, view & pay bills, KYEC enables customers to get details of energy consumption records, enabling them to control electricity consumption. On the other hand, the Smart meter reading device app captures meter reading and bill dispatch process online thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness of process. The GIS Location tracker helps customers receive online update of the technician’s position once he/she logs in a power failure complaint while the Wi-Fi meter reading device captures accurate meter reading eliminating human intervention. Additionally, with initiatives like- High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS), E House and Underground Feeder Pillar (Link Box), the company has helped reduce space constraints & ensured timely installation along with enhanced safety of its distribution network in Mumbai. While the HVDS deploys pole mounted transformers with associated Low Voltage (LV) Distribution, the LV coaxial service cables and the LV connector system are provided with plug-in type design thereby reducing technical losses and enhanced safety features coupled with higher reliability. These technological introductions for HV/LV distribution system are essentially tool free and eliminates the risk of errors in the field. The E House (Electrical House) helps to reduce space and installation time for 33 /11 kV Grid Substations. E House is a prefabricated enclosure housing the 33kV/11 kV switchgear with associated auxiliaries installed, tested and ready to be commissioned once delivered to site. The installation of Underground Feeder Pillar (Link Box) along with a new generation compact & fully insulated service pillar into the LV distribution network, will help to enhance safety and cut down the electrical losses, eliminate the menace of power theft and pilferages in congested areas where space is a constraint. Speaking on the innovations,  Mr. Sanjay Banga, President – Transmission & Distribution, Tata Power  stated,  ""We have been the frontrunner in implementing power distribution reforms in India and have been widely acknowledged for our consumer friendly practices. We aim to introduce further innovations in technology to ensure smooth, secure services for our vast customer base in the coming years."" With the convergence of sectors such as transport and electricity through E-Vehicle and consumers becoming Prosumers, Tata Power has evolved significantly in handling the dynamic demand supply situation and network contingencies."

The big rollout from Tata Power is also coming at a time when consumers across all major categories including commercial, industrial, residential and public sector are now adopting solar energy as a reliable and sustainable solution to meet their energy needs that also holds tremendous potential to save costs. Since the launch of customizable rooftop solar solutions on a pan-India basis in September 2018, ringing testimonials of happy customers continues to pour in on the value of Tata Power rooftop solar solutions across all categories of power consumers. Apoorva Jhaveri, Bhilosa Industries , a leading polyester yarn manufacturer in India said,  “In less than a year since our management decided to commit wholeheartedly to clean energy, we have installed almost 3 MW of rooftop solar at our plant in Silvassa. Both from an environmental sustainability and costs, this is perhaps one of the best investments we have made in the recent past.  With savings in excess of 4.5 million power units so far, we are now expanding it by another 3 MW with full confidence that Tata Power will continue to deliver value for us.” Similarly, Balaji Wafers, a homegrown food products company that is based in Rajkot, Gujarat said that a saving of 7 lakh units of power and around Rs 50 lakh is now expanding its investment in rooftop solar at its factories in Valsad and Indore.  “The value proposition of Tata Power rooftop solar is quite compelling.  We will continue to invest in this,”  said  Jai Sachdev, Head – Marketing at Balaji Wafers . Dinesh Lakhani, a Tata Power Channel Partner,  emphasizes that rooftop solar offers a valuable source of energy that combats climate change. With this as his inspiration, Dinesh has been associated with Tata Power for rendering these services for more than 7 years. By installing 10+ MW of rooftop systems already, Mr Lakhani aims to contribute more towards building a greener and cleaner tomorrow by reducing carbon footprint. For  Mr Abid Siddiqui,  Plant Head, Bisleri International Pvt. Ltd.,  the main factor that accentuates the importance of rooftop solar panels is that they are a clean mode of energy and require very low maintenance. As early adopters of new ideas and technologies, positive experiences of commercial and industrial consumers ushers in big changes in the power sector too.  Consumers in these two categories also usually seek value for money that also delivers on their sustainability objectives. Mr. Praveer Sinha, CEO & MD, Tata Power  said,  “Solar Rooftops not only offer an economical and clean alternative to conventional energy sources but also  deliver reliability. With the increased adoption of RTS by consumers, we are confident that our solar rooftop solutions will play a big role in improving energy access across the country, in both urban and rural parts.” Mr. Ashish Khanna, President, Tata Power (Renewables), said ,  “It is our endeavor to offer consumers the option of clean and green energy, which is not only cost-effective but also helps them in energy conservation. With RTS, we aim to achieve our Company’s objective of ‘Lighting up Lives’.” Rooftop solar installations are also attaining grid parity in many residential sectors of India. Electricity prices keep on fluctuating from time to time. However, when it comes to electricity generated by solar rooftops, the price of power generated can be calculated easily. In fact, one can even calculate the cost of electricity generation for another 10 years. Therefore, for Tata Power’s residential society & institutional customers like  Samarth Aangan, Malad (180KW), Yarrow Yucca Vinka, Chandivali (240 KW), Cardinal Gracias Hospitals, Mira Road (220KW), Planet Godrej C.H.S., Mahalakshmi East (60 KW), WeWorks, Saki Naka (30KW) etc.,  this proves to be a good manner in which to optimize saving on electricity consumption. These conscious citizens are not only able to cut down their electricity bills significantly but also able to calculate and keep a track of the electricity used. The rising popularity of RTS within the Indian power sector is also an outcome of the increasing share of renewable or green energy in the country. So far, Tata Power has installed over 375+ MW of rooftop projects, including some of the most industrialized states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Major cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Surat, Baroda, Delhi, Gurgaon, Agra, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Varanasi, Guwahati, Kolkata, Dhanbad, Puri, Vizag, Vellore, Mysore, Coimbatore and Chennai are also proud proponents of Solar Rooftop Solutions.  Tata Power Solar has also built utility scale projects in 13 states in the country with a total capacity of around 2.76 GW. In 2017, the company executed a 2.6 megawatt (MW) solar rooftop plant at the carport of Kochi International Airport. Incidentally, this is India’s largest solar-powered carport.
