,https://www.tcs.com/building-a-winner-janssen-on-collaborating-on-connected-clinical-trial-platform,22 Oct 2019,"Clinical Research News - 22 Oct 2019 About four years ago, Bert Hartog, senior director, clinical innovation, at Janssen Pharmaceutica, realized that they had huge inefficiencies in clinical trials; were providing sup-optimal support for patients; and weren’t using new technologies the way they should. The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep. The product was recently awarded a European Innovations Award at SCOPE Europe. Read the complete article  here     "
,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "

The outcome is an excellent wide-ranging article highlighting TCS' strategy, commitment, plans and status in the Philippines, one of TCS’ fastest-growing and most important emerging markets. Titled ‘Changing business behaviour key to TCS growth in the Philippines’ the article explained the company’s operations in the Philippines, which represents TCS' fastest growing market outside India, growing at over 40 per cent annually during the past five years. During the interview Varghese acknowledged some of the key challenges for Filipino businesses. He advised leadership figures to adopt the four behaviours of Business 4.0, a framework designed by TCS to help businesses capitalise on the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the four behaviours span driving mass personalisation by being intelligent; creating exponential value by being automated; leveraging ecosystems by being agile and embracing risk through the cloud. “These behaviours go beyond technology, categorising the fundamental mindset shift TCS believes business leaders need to make to transform and thrive,” Varghese explained. “Companies who exhibit these behaviours have strong technology adoption and are more likely to have developed capabilities in automation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and blockchain, for example.” he said.

K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "
TCS,https://www.tcs.com/building-a-winner-janssen-on-collaborating-on-connected-clinical-trial-platform,22 Oct 2019,"Clinical Research News - 22 Oct 2019 About four years ago, Bert Hartog, senior director, clinical innovation, at Janssen Pharmaceutica, realized that they had huge inefficiencies in clinical trials; were providing sup-optimal support for patients; and weren’t using new technologies the way they should. The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep. The product was recently awarded a European Innovations Award at SCOPE Europe. Read the complete article  here     "

K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/tcs-to-take-its-insurance-platform-places,15 Nov 2019,"The Economic Times - November 15, 2019 TCS is doubling down on its insurance platform — which has already won more than $5 billion in business in the last two years — and is looking at newer markets in Continental Europe to expand.   Earlier this week, TCS expanded its contract with Phoenix Group, a long-term client, to include open book policies. The deal expansion is worth over $2 billion, an industry source said. In 2018, TCS won an over $2 billion deal with Trans-America in the United States. “Currently, we have about 4 million open active policies; now with this deal (expanded Phoenix Group project), we will take it to over 7.5 million policies. So, we are changing the nature of our business, we are changing the way we go to market,” Suresh Muthuswami, President of TCS’ BFSI Platforms business, told ET. Read the complete article  here "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "
TCS,https://www.tcs.com/building-a-winner-janssen-on-collaborating-on-connected-clinical-trial-platform,22 Oct 2019,"Clinical Research News - 22 Oct 2019 About four years ago, Bert Hartog, senior director, clinical innovation, at Janssen Pharmaceutica, realized that they had huge inefficiencies in clinical trials; were providing sup-optimal support for patients; and weren’t using new technologies the way they should. The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep. The product was recently awarded a European Innovations Award at SCOPE Europe. Read the complete article  here     "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/digital-transformation-is-not-a-luxury-it-is-a-necessity,18 Feb 2020,"Innovation for innovation’s sake is not enough. K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

Specifically, the four behaviours span driving mass personalisation by being intelligent; creating exponential value by being automated; leveraging ecosystems by being agile and embracing risk through the cloud. “These behaviours go beyond technology, categorising the fundamental mindset shift TCS believes business leaders need to make to transform and thrive,” Varghese explained. “Companies who exhibit these behaviours have strong technology adoption and are more likely to have developed capabilities in automation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and blockchain, for example.” he said.

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/data-quality-for-effective-digital-twins-in-oil-and-gas-arc,01 Jul 2020,"Effective digital twins need high-quality data in real time for common applications like predictive maintenance and optimizing the operational performance of equipment. An intelligent asset inspection program becomes an imperative for success. A digital twin, by definition, replicates attributes of a physical asset. Digital twins enable oil and gas companies to respond with fact-based decision support for the industry challenges, which can be particularly helpful considering the added adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A digital twin needs data for analytics, prediction, and automation. For a useful twin, the data must be of high quality, verified, and referenced. To operate in real time it needs current data and models. Predictive maintenance using data from a particular piece of equipment has been a key driver for adopting digital twins. Once a digital twin of a physical asset has been deployed, it is vital to keep it current to be effective for real-time decision support. "
