TCS,https://www.tcs.com/data-quality-for-effective-digital-twins-in-oil-and-gas-arc,01 Jul 2020,"Effective digital twins need high-quality data in real time for common applications like predictive maintenance and optimizing the operational performance of equipment. An intelligent asset inspection program becomes an imperative for success. A digital twin, by definition, replicates attributes of a physical asset. Digital twins enable oil and gas companies to respond with fact-based decision support for the industry challenges, which can be particularly helpful considering the added adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A digital twin needs data for analytics, prediction, and automation. For a useful twin, the data must be of high quality, verified, and referenced. To operate in real time it needs current data and models. Predictive maintenance using data from a particular piece of equipment has been a key driver for adopting digital twins. Once a digital twin of a physical asset has been deployed, it is vital to keep it current to be effective for real-time decision support. "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/building-a-winner-janssen-on-collaborating-on-connected-clinical-trial-platform,22 Oct 2019,"Clinical Research News - 22 Oct 2019 About four years ago, Bert Hartog, senior director, clinical innovation, at Janssen Pharmaceutica, realized that they had huge inefficiencies in clinical trials; were providing sup-optimal support for patients; and weren’t using new technologies the way they should. The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep.

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/digital-transformation-is-not-a-luxury-it-is-a-necessity,18 Feb 2020,"Innovation for innovation’s sake is not enough. K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/tata-motors-introduces-fleet-edge-next-gen-digital-solution-for-optimal-fleet-management/,"13 July, 2020","Enhances vehicle performance and streamlines  operations for better customer satisfaction Tata Motors,  India’s leading commercial vehicles manufacturer, today announced the launch of  Tata Motors Fleet Edge  – a  next-generation connected vehicle solution that enables fleet management, with  informed decision making.

Customers will also be able to track the due  date of the important vehicle documents. These insights will be available to  customers through a user-friendly interface on Tata Motors Fleet Edge portal  and will help customers manage their fleet even more efficiently. Fleet Edge is  also accessible on smartphones via an app, on real time basis. Speaking about the power  of Fleet Edge,  Mr. Girish Wagh,  President, Commercial Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors  said, “ Digital technology and connectivity  solutions are rapidly transforming both passenger and goods transportation. The  rich data that vehicles can now send through the telematics unit is opening up several  new possibilities for the entire logistics chain. With Fleet Edge, we have set  a new benchmark by providing customers more information and greater control  over their fleet and their operations, remotely. We’re taking data from the  vehicles and using it to help our customers improve their operations. We will  consistently build and introduce enhancements to the Fleet Edge solution to  provide more relevant and customised intelligence for fleet owners and managers  to make informed decisions. The more insights we provide, the more efficient  they become by optimising fleet performance and reducing costs.”  The Fleet  Edge solution is relevant and beneficial across fleet size and is available with  the entire M&HCV BSVI range of Tata Motors trucks and buses and a select  range of I&LCV and SCV models.

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/tata-motors-media-statement-clarification/,"5 August, 2020","Unconfirmed and unsubstantiated reports that have  recently been published by some media on Tata Motors Passenger Vehicle stake sale and potential  partners    In this context, Tata Motors clarifies that:  All such published news about ‘Tata Motors to sell up to 49%  stake in PV Business’ and the names of potential partners/investors mentioned  is incorrect and misleading.   Firstly, TML is India’s foremost home grown auto company.  Its products are receiving strong customer response with its best-in-class  safety, stylish design and superior driveability. Over the years, initiatives  taken by Tata Motors have and will continue to strengthen India and its auto  sector.   In March 2020, TML had announced the intent to subsidiarise  its PV business as the first step towards securing mutually beneficial  strategic alliances that provide access to products, architectures,  powertrains, new-age technologies and capital.   Securing a mutually beneficial alliance is a priority.  However, it is not an imperative for today but an opportunity to be secured for  tomorrow. The imperative for today is to Win Sustainably by delivering  market beating growth and positive free cash flows by delighting our customers  with exciting products and exceptional service while continuing to drive a  strong cost savings agenda . "
TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/q1-fy21-adversely-impacted-by-covid-19/,"31 July, 2020","Tata Motors Ltd announced its results for quarter ending June 30, 2020.     JLR:  The quarter reflected the full impact of COVID-19 with temporary retailer and plant shutdowns for most part of the quarter. However, the transformation programme continued to gain momentum resulting in positive EBITDA despite significant volume drop in the quarter and lower cash outflow as compared to the earlier expectations. Project Charge delivered £1.2b of cost, profit, and cash flow improvements in the quarter. TML:  In India, the nationwide lockdown resulted in the production and retailer shutdowns for major part of the quarter and heavily impacted the volumes. For TML, Q1 was marked by successful transition to BSVI and a sharp increase in PV market shares to 9.5% with the “New Forever” range. Negative operating leverage impacted the performance significantly. However, cash out flows were better than earlier expectations driven by the improvement initiatives which yielded Rs 1020Cr of cash savings in the quarter.  Outlook:  The outlook remains uncertain for the year with infections continuing to rise and intermittent lockdowns in many countries. However, we expect a gradual recovery of demand and supply in the coming months. In this context, we are committed to significantly deleveraging the business in the coming years and aim to generate positive free cash flows over last 3 quarters of the year by focusing on better front end activations of our exciting product range, and executing our cost and cash savings with rigour.  JAGUAR LAND ROVER (JLR) Highlights Financials The Covid-19 pandemic continued to significantly impact the business in Q1FY21, with retail unit sales down 42.4% year-on-year. However, monthly sales improved during the quarter across all regions as economies re-opened, with June sales down 24.9%. About 98% of Jaguar Land Rover’s retailers worldwide are now fully or partially open and all the company’s plants have resumed manufacturing, except for the Castle Bromwich facility, which will gradually restart from 10th August. Revenue was £2.9b in the quarter and the company made a pre-tax loss of £413m. However, this was only down £18m year-on-year and the EBITDA margin was 3.5% with £500m of Charge+ cost actions substantially offsetting the lower sales. Free cash flow was negative £1.5b, primarily reflecting a one-time working capital outflow of £1.1b. Reassuringly, the Chery Jaguar Land Rover Joint Venture in China achieved break-even profits in the quarter. Overall, these results were better than expected with total cost and cash flow improvements of £1.2b realised in the quarter from the Charge+ program. The company successfully completed about £650m of new funding and ended the quarter with solid liquidity of £4.7b including £2.75b of cash and short-term investments and £1.9b undrawn revolving credit facility.  Looking Ahead Sales of the New Land Rover Defender started to ramp up in the UK, Europe and North America with China and other markets starting from July onwards. Plug-in hybrid and the Hard-Top commercial derivatives will be available later in the year. The expected recovery in sales will also be supported by the newly revealed enhancements to the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. These flagship vehicles are now available with special editions and a suite of upgrades, including Jaguar Land Rover’s new 3.0-litre straight-six cylinder Ingenium diesel engine with Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology. Both feature advanced connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto offered as standard. Passenger wellbeing has been enhanced with new Cabin Air Ionisation, which filters harmful particulates and improves interior air quality. For the rest of FY21, Jaguar Land Rover will continue to manage costs and investment spending rigorously. After realising £1.2b of total cost and cash improvements under Charge+ in the quarter, the company has increased its target for FY21 from £1.5b to £2.5b. This brings the total Charge+ savings so far to £4.7b, with a target of £6b by the end of March 2021. While the outlook remains uncertain, we expect a gradual increase in sales, profitability and cash flow over the year. In Q2FY21, volumes may not pick up sufficiently to generate a profit, however, cash flow is expected to be positive, supported by improved working capital and continued savings. Investment spending is expected to be £2.5b for FY21.  Prof Sir Ralf Speth, JLR Chief Executive commented,  “ Jaguar Land Rover has reacted with resilience and agility to the extraordinary challenges faced in the first three months of FY21 adapting rapidly to the widespread macroeconomic disruption and uncertainty. Through this period, we have continued to bring outstanding new vehicles to market, electrifying our multi-award-winning range and building the new Land Rover Defender, an icon reimagined for the digital age. As the lockdowns ease, we will emerge from the pandemic with our most advanced product range yet, and with the financial and operating measures in place to return to long-term sustainable profit.   The fundamental strengths of Jaguar Land Rover have been tested in 2020, and we will pass this test to succeed in the future. Our exciting pipeline of new, advanced products places us at the forefront of our industry. We have a clear plan, a highly skilled, creative team, and unparalleled technical capabilities. I look forward to working with my successor Thierry Bolloré as Jaguar Land Rover focuses on its Destination Zero mission, and seeks to deliver the autonomous, connected, electric and shared experiences that our customers will love, for life with integrity . ”  TATA MOTORS (STANDALONE INCL. JOINT OPERATIONS) Business Highlights Financials The Company responded quickly to the current crisis and instituted rigorous cost and investment controls to conserve cash as much as possible and managed the supply chain nimbly to restart operations as soon as possible in May-20 while taking care to ensure the safety of our employees. In Q1FY21 wholesales (including exports) decreased 81.5% to 25,294 units. In the domestic volumes were down by: M&HCV -92.1%, ILCV -92.1%, SCV & Pick Ups -85.4% and CV Passenger -97.2%. Domestic PV volumes were down 60.6% .Overall domestic retails were lower than wholesales by 2.5K units as pipeline inventory in CV improves. Revenue for the quarter decreased 80% to Rs 2.7KCr and pre-tax loss before exceptional items was Rs 2,141Cr (against pre-tax loss of Rs 40Cr in Q1FY20) due to steep volume decline and negative operating leverage. Free cash flow for the quarter was Rs (4.3) KCr, better than expected as the company drove the cost and cash savings agenda hard with Rs 1020Cr delivered in Q1FY21. The investment spends were reduced significantly to Rs 492 Cr for the quarter. The company ended the first quarter with a strong liquidity of Rs 6.9 KCr.  Looking Ahead We look forward to a gradual pickup in demand and supply situation on the back of overall economic recovery expected in H2FY21. The company will focus on conserving cash by rigorously managing cost and investment spends to protect liquidity. The company has called out a cash improvement program of Rs 6000Cr including a cost improvement program of Rs 1500Cr. Capex is expected to be around Rs 1500Cr for FY21. Due to these actions, the company expects improving cash flows for the remainder of the year and expects to end the FY21 with positive free cash flows. Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the auto industry in Q1FY21. Post a calibrated restart at all plants in mid-May, we gradually scaled up our capacity while prudently safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our employees as well as the larger ecosystem. Even as we continue to address the challenges, we see some disruption due to the intermittent shutdowns and supply chain bottlenecks. We have witnessed some green shoots emerging in PV owing to some pent up demand pre COVID, and are hopeful for a full recovery of the CV industry by end of the fiscal year, with a gradual pickup of demand, aligned to the economic recovery. We remain focused on making Tata Motors more agile to improve our market, operational and financial performance by reducing costs, generating free cash flows and providing the best in class customer experience.”  ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Consolidated Numbers, Ind AS) Finance Costs  Finance costs increased by Rs 165Cr to Rs 1,877Cr during Q1FY’21 vs prior year due to higher gross borrowings as compared to Q1FY’20 Joint ventures, Associates and Other income  For the quarter, net loss from joint ventures and associates amounted to Rs 60Cr compared with a loss of Rs 245Cr in prior year. Other income (excluding grants) was Rs 228Cr versus Rs 292Cr in the prior year  Free Cash Flows Free cash flow (automotive) in the quarter, was negative Rs 18.2 KCr (as compared to negative Rs 11.6K Cr in Q1FY 20) reflecting the adverse working capital and wider disruptions caused by the plant and retailer shutdowns across both India business and Jaguar Land Rover Tax Expenses The tax expenses for quarter ended June 30, 2020 was Rs 2.2KCr, representing an Effective Tax Rate (“ETR”) of (36)% impacted by non-recognition of Deferred Tax Assets on UK tax losses and pension charges going through Other Comprehensive Income Notes:  Joint Operations refers to Fiat Automobiles Pvt Ltd and Tata Cummins Pvt Ltd Statement of Consolidated Financial Results for the Quarter ended June 30, 2020 Statement of Standalone Financial Results for the Quarter ended June 30, 2020 "

TCS,https://www.tcs.com/is-mass-personalization-the-next-big-hurdle-for-manufacturers,17 Oct 2019,"Forbes - 17 Oct 2019 As with any business, manufacturers constantly face a host of marketplace challenges. Currently topping the list are hyper-competitive business models, ever-increasing regulatory burdens, expert workforce availability, reskilling and training requirements and costs, and the effects of global geopolitics such as tariffs and human rights concerns. What is not getting attention right now is mass personalization. Though it’s a concept that’s been around for years, and one which various producers have toyed with from time to time, it has never really taken off in a big way, whether because of scalability, viability or both. That may be changing, according to Sreenivasa Chakravarti, VP of the Manufacturing Business Practice at TCS, where they have found that manufacturing is leading the move toward mass personalization, but that many producers are in danger of being left behind if they do not embrace digital technologies. “One of the things we’ve been looking at is how industry is shaping up, given the commoditization of manufacturing,” Chakravarti said. “How are producers identifying differentiating competencies? The best ones are re-looking at their own businesses and identifying adjacent capabilities. They realize there are much bigger business opportunities out there.” Read the complete article  here "

The Janssen team started to outline a platform to solve these problems, and after extensive internal needs assessment, the team set out to find a technology partner to build the platform. ""There wasn't anything available on the market,"" Hartog told Clinical Research News, ""so we did a very comprehensive market search for the right partner to develop this platform. We were hoping to find a partner who would be able to do two things: one, build the platform, and second, take this platform to the industry for sites to benefit from what might become a standardized approach of working."" They found a likeminded partner in Tata Consultancy Services. The development was very collaborative, said Hartog. Janssen outlined the initial requirements, and together the partners ‘co-created’ iStep—the integrated smart trial engagement platform. ""We have done conceptualizing, proofs-of-concept, and technology pilots,"" Hartog recounts. ""Along the way there was a transition of ownership. Janssen made it very clear: we don't want to end up owning this platform, we want to be a user, because that allows (TCS) to market it to get to standardization,"" Hartog explained. Today, the platform is available as TCS’ Connected Clinical Trials (CCT) platform, with modules and offerings that extend beyond iStep. The product was recently awarded a European Innovations Award at SCOPE Europe. Read the complete article  here     "
TCS,https://www.tcs.com/data-quality-for-effective-digital-twins-in-oil-and-gas-arc,01 Jul 2020,"Effective digital twins need high-quality data in real time for common applications like predictive maintenance and optimizing the operational performance of equipment. An intelligent asset inspection program becomes an imperative for success. A digital twin, by definition, replicates attributes of a physical asset. Digital twins enable oil and gas companies to respond with fact-based decision support for the industry challenges, which can be particularly helpful considering the added adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A digital twin needs data for analytics, prediction, and automation. For a useful twin, the data must be of high quality, verified, and referenced. To operate in real time it needs current data and models. Predictive maintenance using data from a particular piece of equipment has been a key driver for adopting digital twins. Once a digital twin of a physical asset has been deployed, it is vital to keep it current to be effective for real-time decision support. "

K Ananth Krishnan, CTO, Tata Consultancy Services, discusses how companies can enact digital transformation more effectively. Digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and cloud computing have the potential to transform the way businesses structure themselves, develop new products and highly customize customer experiences. This potential for change is widely known as ‘digital transformation’, but what does that really mean? Digital transformation is complex, and while many business leaders have a clear idea of how they want their businesses to change, they are far less clear about the steps needed to get them to their destination. Krishnan elaborates on how companies can drive digital transformation more effectively, and explains the four branches, or ‘behaviors’, of successful digital transformation. These four behaviors are: driving mass personalization, creating exponential value, leveraging ecosystems, and embracing risk. Read the complete article  here "

During the interview Varghese acknowledged some of the key challenges for Filipino businesses. He advised leadership figures to adopt the four behaviours of Business 4.0, a framework designed by TCS to help businesses capitalise on the promise of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, the four behaviours span driving mass personalisation by being intelligent; creating exponential value by being automated; leveraging ecosystems by being agile and embracing risk through the cloud. “These behaviours go beyond technology, categorising the fundamental mindset shift TCS believes business leaders need to make to transform and thrive,” Varghese explained. “Companies who exhibit these behaviours have strong technology adoption and are more likely to have developed capabilities in automation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and blockchain, for example.” he said.

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/q1-fy21-adversely-impacted-by-covid-19/,"31 July, 2020","Tata Motors Ltd announced its results for quarter ending June 30, 2020.     JLR:  The quarter reflected the full impact of COVID-19 with temporary retailer and plant shutdowns for most part of the quarter. However, the transformation programme continued to gain momentum resulting in positive EBITDA despite significant volume drop in the quarter and lower cash outflow as compared to the earlier expectations. Project Charge delivered £1.2b of cost, profit, and cash flow improvements in the quarter. TML:  In India, the nationwide lockdown resulted in the production and retailer shutdowns for major part of the quarter and heavily impacted the volumes. For TML, Q1 was marked by successful transition to BSVI and a sharp increase in PV market shares to 9.5% with the “New Forever” range. Negative operating leverage impacted the performance significantly. However, cash out flows were better than earlier expectations driven by the improvement initiatives which yielded Rs 1020Cr of cash savings in the quarter.  Outlook:  The outlook remains uncertain for the year with infections continuing to rise and intermittent lockdowns in many countries. However, we expect a gradual recovery of demand and supply in the coming months. In this context, we are committed to significantly deleveraging the business in the coming years and aim to generate positive free cash flows over last 3 quarters of the year by focusing on better front end activations of our exciting product range, and executing our cost and cash savings with rigour.  JAGUAR LAND ROVER (JLR) Highlights Financials The Covid-19 pandemic continued to significantly impact the business in Q1FY21, with retail unit sales down 42.4% year-on-year. However, monthly sales improved during the quarter across all regions as economies re-opened, with June sales down 24.9%. About 98% of Jaguar Land Rover’s retailers worldwide are now fully or partially open and all the company’s plants have resumed manufacturing, except for the Castle Bromwich facility, which will gradually restart from 10th August. Revenue was £2.9b in the quarter and the company made a pre-tax loss of £413m. However, this was only down £18m year-on-year and the EBITDA margin was 3.5% with £500m of Charge+ cost actions substantially offsetting the lower sales. Free cash flow was negative £1.5b, primarily reflecting a one-time working capital outflow of £1.1b. Reassuringly, the Chery Jaguar Land Rover Joint Venture in China achieved break-even profits in the quarter. Overall, these results were better than expected with total cost and cash flow improvements of £1.2b realised in the quarter from the Charge+ program. The company successfully completed about £650m of new funding and ended the quarter with solid liquidity of £4.7b including £2.75b of cash and short-term investments and £1.9b undrawn revolving credit facility.  Looking Ahead Sales of the New Land Rover Defender started to ramp up in the UK, Europe and North America with China and other markets starting from July onwards. Plug-in hybrid and the Hard-Top commercial derivatives will be available later in the year. The expected recovery in sales will also be supported by the newly revealed enhancements to the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. These flagship vehicles are now available with special editions and a suite of upgrades, including Jaguar Land Rover’s new 3.0-litre straight-six cylinder Ingenium diesel engine with Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology. Both feature advanced connectivity with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto offered as standard. Passenger wellbeing has been enhanced with new Cabin Air Ionisation, which filters harmful particulates and improves interior air quality. For the rest of FY21, Jaguar Land Rover will continue to manage costs and investment spending rigorously. After realising £1.2b of total cost and cash improvements under Charge+ in the quarter, the company has increased its target for FY21 from £1.5b to £2.5b. This brings the total Charge+ savings so far to £4.7b, with a target of £6b by the end of March 2021. While the outlook remains uncertain, we expect a gradual increase in sales, profitability and cash flow over the year. In Q2FY21, volumes may not pick up sufficiently to generate a profit, however, cash flow is expected to be positive, supported by improved working capital and continued savings. Investment spending is expected to be £2.5b for FY21.  Prof Sir Ralf Speth, JLR Chief Executive commented,  “ Jaguar Land Rover has reacted with resilience and agility to the extraordinary challenges faced in the first three months of FY21 adapting rapidly to the widespread macroeconomic disruption and uncertainty. Through this period, we have continued to bring outstanding new vehicles to market, electrifying our multi-award-winning range and building the new Land Rover Defender, an icon reimagined for the digital age. As the lockdowns ease, we will emerge from the pandemic with our most advanced product range yet, and with the financial and operating measures in place to return to long-term sustainable profit.   The fundamental strengths of Jaguar Land Rover have been tested in 2020, and we will pass this test to succeed in the future. Our exciting pipeline of new, advanced products places us at the forefront of our industry. We have a clear plan, a highly skilled, creative team, and unparalleled technical capabilities. I look forward to working with my successor Thierry Bolloré as Jaguar Land Rover focuses on its Destination Zero mission, and seeks to deliver the autonomous, connected, electric and shared experiences that our customers will love, for life with integrity . ”  TATA MOTORS (STANDALONE INCL. JOINT OPERATIONS) Business Highlights Financials The Company responded quickly to the current crisis and instituted rigorous cost and investment controls to conserve cash as much as possible and managed the supply chain nimbly to restart operations as soon as possible in May-20 while taking care to ensure the safety of our employees. In Q1FY21 wholesales (including exports) decreased 81.5% to 25,294 units. In the domestic volumes were down by: M&HCV -92.1%, ILCV -92.1%, SCV & Pick Ups -85.4% and CV Passenger -97.2%. Domestic PV volumes were down 60.6% .Overall domestic retails were lower than wholesales by 2.5K units as pipeline inventory in CV improves. Revenue for the quarter decreased 80% to Rs 2.7KCr and pre-tax loss before exceptional items was Rs 2,141Cr (against pre-tax loss of Rs 40Cr in Q1FY20) due to steep volume decline and negative operating leverage. Free cash flow for the quarter was Rs (4.3) KCr, better than expected as the company drove the cost and cash savings agenda hard with Rs 1020Cr delivered in Q1FY21. The investment spends were reduced significantly to Rs 492 Cr for the quarter. The company ended the first quarter with a strong liquidity of Rs 6.9 KCr.  Looking Ahead We look forward to a gradual pickup in demand and supply situation on the back of overall economic recovery expected in H2FY21. The company will focus on conserving cash by rigorously managing cost and investment spends to protect liquidity. The company has called out a cash improvement program of Rs 6000Cr including a cost improvement program of Rs 1500Cr. Capex is expected to be around Rs 1500Cr for FY21. Due to these actions, the company expects improving cash flows for the remainder of the year and expects to end the FY21 with positive free cash flows. Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted the auto industry in Q1FY21. Post a calibrated restart at all plants in mid-May, we gradually scaled up our capacity while prudently safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our employees as well as the larger ecosystem. Even as we continue to address the challenges, we see some disruption due to the intermittent shutdowns and supply chain bottlenecks. We have witnessed some green shoots emerging in PV owing to some pent up demand pre COVID, and are hopeful for a full recovery of the CV industry by end of the fiscal year, with a gradual pickup of demand, aligned to the economic recovery. We remain focused on making Tata Motors more agile to improve our market, operational and financial performance by reducing costs, generating free cash flows and providing the best in class customer experience.”  ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Consolidated Numbers, Ind AS) Finance Costs  Finance costs increased by Rs 165Cr to Rs 1,877Cr during Q1FY’21 vs prior year due to higher gross borrowings as compared to Q1FY’20 Joint ventures, Associates and Other income  For the quarter, net loss from joint ventures and associates amounted to Rs 60Cr compared with a loss of Rs 245Cr in prior year. Other income (excluding grants) was Rs 228Cr versus Rs 292Cr in the prior year  Free Cash Flows Free cash flow (automotive) in the quarter, was negative Rs 18.2 KCr (as compared to negative Rs 11.6K Cr in Q1FY 20) reflecting the adverse working capital and wider disruptions caused by the plant and retailer shutdowns across both India business and Jaguar Land Rover Tax Expenses The tax expenses for quarter ended June 30, 2020 was Rs 2.2KCr, representing an Effective Tax Rate (“ETR”) of (36)% impacted by non-recognition of Deferred Tax Assets on UK tax losses and pension charges going through Other Comprehensive Income Notes:  Joint Operations refers to Fiat Automobiles Pvt Ltd and Tata Cummins Pvt Ltd Statement of Consolidated Financial Results for the Quarter ended June 30, 2020 Statement of Standalone Financial Results for the Quarter ended June 30, 2020 "
