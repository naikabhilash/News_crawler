Maruti_Suzuki,https://www.tatasteel.com/media/newsroom/press-releases/india/2020/tata-shaktee-completes-its-20-year-journey-as-the-leader-in-india-s-gc-roof-market/,2020-08-06,"~ Launched in 2000 as the first national galvanized corrugated roof brand in India ~ ~ Leads with a 34% share in the organized GC roof market in the country ~ ~ Established as a household brand name for roofing structures in rural India ~ Tata Shaktee, the leader in India’s galvanized corrugated (GC) roof market, completes its glorious two-decade-long journey this year. Introduced as an affordable and credible alternative to reinforced cement concrete (RCC) roof in 2000, Tata Shaktee today commands a third of India’s highly competitive GC roof market with its enviable reach into the country’s rural market.  Since its launch, Tata Shaktee has also emerged as the brand that changed the face of the corrugated sheet category in India. Today, as the undisputed market leader, Tata Shaktee owes its success to innovative products and services, continuous nurturing of the distribution channel, and sharply-focused and effective brand communication. Sanjay S. Sahni, Chief of Marketing & Sales (Branded Products & Retail), Tata Steel, said:  “Since its launch two decades ago, Tata Shaktee has been a revolutionary idea for several reasons. It is among the first retail brands from Tata Steel that succeeded in bringing a professional structure to the highly unorganized GC roof market in India and make it customer friendly. By the sheer persuasion of its superior quality and transparent pricing, today Tata Shaktee is known as the brand that put a roof on rural India and stands as an epitome of trust. We expect to continue on this successful journey through product and pricing innovation and most importantly keeping the culture of customer satisfaction ahead of everything else.” The recently introduced thinner sizes ranging between 0.20 and 0.28 mm has helped Tata Shaktee create new markets by offering the best-in-class products made affordable to a wider range of consumers, particularly in rural India. Further, through Tata Shaktee’s Roof Junction Service, consumers also get ready to use fully-fabricated roofs made by skilled hands and two follow-up maintenance inspections in the first year of installation. Additionally, the Company also provides a two-year warranty against leakage. Further, product innovations like WAMA was launched to cater to the demand for vertical applications for walling and fencing needs. Long Length Tata Shaktee GC Sheets were also launched to further provide SKUs for lengths up to 24 feet. The Roof Building basket is completed by the Range of Branded Accessories provided by the Company that includes Ridges and Gutters. As the country’s first GC sheet brand, Tata Shaktee enjoys several consumer-centric firsts to its credit including the first one to print the sheet thickness and the zinc coating in grams per square meter (GSM) on the sheet. It additionally ensured that all the sheets had a uniform 120 GSM zinc coating. Tata Shaktee was the also the first branded RCC product to introduce the concept of Recommended Consumer Price (RCP) that allowed the manufacturer to set the price at which a product could be sold to a customer. This simple act eliminated price cheating and ensured that there could be no black marketing caused by artificial shortages. Tata Shaktee was also the first to introduce 910 mm and 1220 mm sheets to provide greater coverage and thus more value. Being wider than the standard 800 mm GC sheets, a fewer number of GC sheets are required to cover the same area. This resulted in fewer overlaps, a lesser number of joints, and reduced wastage. Over the last two decades, Tata Shaktee has also emerged as a multi-award bagger under several consumer and industry categories including being the only Superbrand in the GC roof market in India. The brand has won many RMAI awards, three WOW awards and two ET Champions of Rural Marketing Award for its outstanding marketing campaigns. Tata Shaktee is manufactured in the Company’s iconic Jamshedpur steel plant which has been bestowed with the Prime Minister’s trophy for Best Performing Integrated Steel Plant in India for several years. In 2020, the iconic brand is celebrating a glorious journey of  ‘Garv ke 20 Saal’  with aspirations to enable rural India to ‘Live with Pride’ for many more years to come. About Tata Steel Tata Steel group is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 34 million tonnes per annum. It is one of the world's most geographically-diversified steel producers, with operations and commercial presence across the world. The group (excluding SEA operations) recorded a consolidated turnover of US $19.7 billion in the financial year ending March 31, 2020.

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/tata-motors-media-statement-clarification/,2020-08-05,"Unconfirmed and unsubstantiated reports that have  recently been published by some media on Tata Motors Passenger Vehicle stake sale and potential  partners    In this context, Tata Motors clarifies that:  All such published news about ‘Tata Motors to sell up to 49%  stake in PV Business’ and the names of potential partners/investors mentioned  is incorrect and misleading.   Firstly, TML is India’s foremost home grown auto company.  Its products are receiving strong customer response with its best-in-class  safety, stylish design and superior driveability. Over the years, initiatives  taken by Tata Motors have and will continue to strengthen India and its auto  sector.   In March 2020, TML had announced the intent to subsidiarise  its PV business as the first step towards securing mutually beneficial  strategic alliances that provide access to products, architectures,  powertrains, new-age technologies and capital.   Securing a mutually beneficial alliance is a priority.  However, it is not an imperative for today but an opportunity to be secured for  tomorrow. The imperative for today is to Win Sustainably by delivering  market beating growth and positive free cash flows by delighting our customers  with exciting products and exceptional service while continuing to drive a  strong cost savings agenda .

TataMotors,https://www.tatamotors.com/press/atmanirbharta-by-tata-motors-a-digital-campaign-vocalising-the-need-for-local/,2020-08-10,"Tata Motors, India’s leading auto brand in association with WATConsult, the globally awarded hybrid digital agency from the house of Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN) India, today announced the launch of ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ – a digital campaign highlighting the existence of localisation in everything that we do. Designed and conceptualised by WATConsult, this campaign has been released ahead of the glorious occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day and emphasises on the meaning of ‘Atmanirbharta’ or self-reliance for individuals and the nation as a whole. Solidifying the brand’s stance for the ‘Vocal for Local’ initiative, the campaign is headlined by a video, which begins with a very young boy named Rohan shown seated in the rear seat of a Tata Nexon, while his father is driving him across the town. The son inquisitively asks his father, “Atmanirbharta kya hoti hai?” i.e. “What does Atmanirbharta mean?”. By showing a range of occupations to his son, the father makes him understand that Atmanirbharta means being self-reliant in all aspects of life and that it applies to people from all walks of life – be it a toymaker, bangle vendor, scientist or an engineer from ISRO, who sequentially appear in the film. The video ends with the display of Tata Motors’ New Forever range near a hoisted Indian flag, exemplifying the Company’s ability to deliver best in class products that cater to the local needs & tastes while evolving with time and being ever popular with customers. Adding to the above, ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ highlights that reaching the goal of being self-reliant is not an individualistic responsibility, but a collective one that falls on the shoulders of the entire country. Commenting on the launch of this campaign, Mr. Vivek Srivatsa, Head Marketing, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicle Business Unit said,  “Tata Motors has always been known as an automotive brand that is a flag bearer for products that caters to the Indian customer. Our cars are manufactured locally and provide world class Design, Safety and Driving pleasure to all. We are proud to be at the forefront of the conversation of being ‘Vocal for Local’. This campaign is our tribute to all the people and the homegrown businesses in India who make our country what it is. I am glad that both Tata Motors and WATConsult took this opportunity to emphasise on this message, and thereby in our own small way, we want to encourage the nation to understand a few aspects of being ‘Atmanirbhar’. Through the ‘Atmanirbharta by Tata Motors’ campaign, we want to steer relevant conversation around the subject by sharing our perspective, while encouraging our customers and the country to work towards this overarching goal.” Talking about the campaign, Ms. Heeru Dingra, CEO, WATConsult added , “We are happy to have extended our relations with Tata Motors to curate a concept on a topic that is so relevant in today’s time. The idea was to promote and appreciate the concept of ‘Atmanirbharta’, which is becoming a necessary trait and a motto for our nation. While the animation makes the video more endearing, the narrative seamlessly portrays the potential that India drives, in terms of talent, power and various other aspects, in today’s age. With this video we are confident that we will be able to help each one of us understand the importance of being self-dependent along with respecting all the workers from different strata of life who are in their own way making our nation self-reliant.” This campaign’s concept takes an adaptive approach by using an animated video for the film as a substitution for a live action version, keeping into consideration the ongoing need for physical distancing. Initially launched in our national language – Hindi, this video will also be translated in English and multiple other regional languages to create a nationwide resonance.
