It is encouraging to see that a lot of people are getting involved with equity markets. “But, at the same time, I think a lot of these investors could be first-time investors,” says Gajri. He further added that very young people are trying to dabble in the market for the first time and enjoying the highs or the ‘beginners luck’ in a way to see the market rise from the lows of March 2020. We have seen a spectacular rise pretty much across the board be it largecaps, midcaps or smallcaps. Everyone has made money but having said that, people need to realize that equity markets are not a ‘gambling den’ and true benefits of investing are seen over the long-term. The equity market is a two-way street. So you will see very sharp moves on either side. “My whole belief is that everyone who invests in equity markets needs to be fully aware of these risks, and then invest. With that said, there is nothing wrong with trading for short term gains,” explains Gajri. “Clear understanding of both aspects of investing is extremely important. And at the same time, people need to realize that spectacular gains are just a question of luck,” he said. ",markets,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 05:08 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The S&P BSE Sensex plunged 433 points to 37,877 while the Nifty50 dropped 122 points to close at 11,178. On a weekly basis, the Sensex fell 0.4 percent while the Nifty50 was down 0.3 percent. Weak global cues, profit-booking at higher levels, uncertainty over US-China’s trade meeting and dimming hopes of a rate cut after a rise in inflation in July capped the upside for the bulls, say experts. “Indian markets tracked weak global cues in the later part of the trading day to end with losses. The uncertainty was with regards to the US-China trade meet this weekend and a lack of wholesome pickup in economic activity in many countries, including China,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol. The Indian retail inflation numbers that were above the MPCs’ target also put in doubt chances of a rate cut by the RBI, which the market was looking forward to, he said. Weak results, especially in the auto sector, also contributed to the losses. Sectorally, action was seen in healthcare, metals, and consumer durable names, while profit-taking was visible in auto, banks, finance and oil & gas stocks. On the broader markets front, the S&P BSE midcap index was down more than 1 percent while the smallcap index fell 0.5 percent. Top Nifty gainers included Sun Pharma, Coal India and JSW Steel. . Stocks & Sectors Sectorally, action was seen in the S&P BSE Metal index that was up 0.7 percent followed by the healthcare index that rose 0.75 percent and the consumer durables index was up 0.06 percent. Selling pressure was seen in the S&P BSE auto index that was down 2.5 percent, followed by the Bankex that slipped 2.1 percent and the finance index dropped 1.8 percent. A volume spike of more than 100 percent was seen in stocks like NTPC, Escorts, Siemens, and Lupin. Long buildup was seen in stocks like Lupin, Cadila Healthcare and Tata Steel.

He has remained largely in the shadows since the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition government came to power in the state, but there are talks within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which suggest he will have a very 'crucial role' to play in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections. The buzz around his appointment has been growing louder since he chaired a core committee meeting of the saffron party’s Bihar unit on August 13. In all likelihood, he will be handed over the important charge for strategizing for the Bihar polls. News agency ANI quoted sources in the BJP as saying: “What will be his role in the Bihar Assembly elections has not been decided yet.” The central leadership has directed the state leadership to keep Fadnavis up to date with all decisions and developments related to the Bihar elections, the report said. The former Maharashtra CM has reportedly been tasked with participating in every important meeting related to the Bihar polls, which is due in October-November.

""Experts have opined that during the months of August and September we may witness a surge in COVID-19 cases. We may report between 10,000 to 20,000 cases per day,"" she said in a video campaign urging the youth to join the ""Covid Brigade"" to halt the pandemic spread. Noting that the death rate graph will start rising if the positive cases shoot up, the Minister said it should be stopped. ""We must also understand that the death toll will increase with the rise in the number of cases. So, we need to put a hold on the rise in cases. For that the people must cooperate. They should strictly follow the health protocol of wearing masks, handwashing and social distancing in order to break the chain of virus from spreading,"" Shailaja said.

Instead, to make sure you’re getting every drop for your buck, make sure to follow these pointers and avoid getting scammed at fuelling stations. (Representative image) 1. Always fill at a reputed fuelling station. If you have a pump near to your house or work space, make sure you always fill up there. If you build up a rapport with the workers, they could spill secrets you may not know otherwise. (Representative image) 2. If you drive a car, it is always advisable to step out and check on the meter and the nozzle before filling fuel. Also, while already outside, make sure you keep an eye on the meter at all times until your vehicle is refuelled. (Representative image) 3. Beware of the start-stop scam. A common method pumps use to scam motorists is filling up a lower amount ‘by mistake’. For example, say you have asked for fuel worth Rs 1,500. The attendant fills up only Rs 500 worth and after being pointed out his mistake goes ahead and pretends to reset the machine and fills up to Rs 1,000. All the while, you could be under the impression that you received Rs 1,500 worth of fuel. (Representative image) 4. You could also ask the attendant to lock the nozzle in place and let go. Pumps usually have an auto cut-off system that cuts off supply when the desired quantity is reached or the tank is full (whichever comes earlier). (Representative image) 5. If you doubt the quantity, ask for a measuring test. Petrol Pumps usually have a 5-litre jar supplied by the Weights and Measures Department. Use this to fill up the can yourself and if anything less than the amount fills up, you can report the pump to the police.

We are in talks with multiple people right now and some of them have already gone through the due diligence phase.” During FY20, M&M (which has its own electric vehicle division) and Mahindra Electric Mobility clocked sales of 14,602 units (966 four-wheelers and 13,636 units of three-wheelers), recording 42 percent growth over the 10,276 units (1,811 four-wheelers and 8,465 three-wheelers) sold in FY19. By the time stricter Corporate Average Fuel Economy norms (global norms that are aimed at lowering fuel consumption) are introduced in India by 2022, M&M will have a ‘substantial size’ of electric vehicles in its portfolio, Goenka added. The much-delayed battery electric version of the KUV100 will finally be launched this quarter, making it the fourth launch (after Hyundai Kona, MG ZS EV, Tata Nexon EV) in the electric SUV space. In the next few quarters the electric version of the XUV300 will be launched. M&M, through its subsidiary Mahindra Electric Mobility, has invested in development of the next-generation EV platform MESMA 350. The Mahindra Electric Scalable and Modular Architecture 350 is a 350 volt powertrain that supports motor sizes ranging from 60 kW to 280 kW, dual motor concepts and battery sizes up to 80 kWh.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-dip-by-25-in-july-fada-5676571.html,Passenger vehicle retail sales dip by 25% in July: FADA,"Automobile dealers' body FADA on August 10 said passenger vehicle (PV) retail sales in July declined by 25.19 percent to 1,57,373 units as compared to the same month last year as coronavirus pandemic continued to impact vehicle offtakes. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), which collected vehicle registration data from 1,235 out of the 1,445 regional transport offices (RTOs), PV sales stood at 2,10,377 units in July 2019. Two-wheeler sales declined 37.47 percent to 8,74,638 units last month as compared to 13,98,702 units in July 2019. Commercial vehicle sales declined 72.18 percent to 19,293 units as compared to 69,338 units in July 2019. Three-wheeler sales declined by 74.33 percent to 15,132 units last month as compared with 58,940 units in July 2019. Total sales across categories declined 36.27 percent to 11,42,633 units last month as against 17,92,879 units in the year-ago month. Commenting on the July retail sales, FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said as the country continues to open up, last month saw better registrations compared to June, though on a year on year basis auto sector recovery is yet to be seen anywhere near normal. Current market conditions are still not indicative of the actual demand situation on an all India level and retail continue to de-grow in huge double-digit despite the low base of last year, he noted. The rural market though continues to show strong sales growth for tractor, small commercial vehicles and motorcycle segments as monsoon continue its good spell, Kale said. Banks and NBFCs though flush with high liquidity are still having a cautious approach towards funding auto retail affecting the demand revival especially in the commercial vehicle, three wheeler and two wheeler segments, he added. ""FADA once again appeals to the government to announce demand boosting policies as this will ensure the speedier revival of the auto sector. The industry eagerly awaits incentive based scrappage policy and this will provide great fillip to medium and heavy commercial vehicles sales,"" Kale noted. On sales outlook for August, he said if there were no further lockdowns, especially in auto manufacturing hubs, the outlook for the month is positive in comparison to July. The full year outlook, however, continues to remain negative with a projected de-growth in retail sales in the range of 15-35 percent across various segments except tractors which looks set to clock a positive annual growth, Kale said. As per FADA data, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) continued to lead domestic passenger vehicle retails in July with 50.4 percent market share. It was followed by Hyundai Motor India (18.69 percent), Tata Motors (8.1 percent), Mahindra & Mahindra (4.96 percent), Kia Motors (4.45 percent), Renault (3.18 percent), Toyota Kirloskar Motor (2.79 percent) and Honda Cars (2.1 percent).

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Vighnesh Shahane, managing director and chief executive officer of IDBI Federal Life Insurance, said there is a need to get a bank distributor quickly, and that the insurer is on the lookout for a potential bancassurance partner. Shahane added that IDBI Bank-led sales have now come down to less than 5 percent, compared to the peak of 50-55 percent about three years ago. The sale started to decline after Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) took 51 percent stake in the bank. IDBI Bank now sells LIC policies too in its bank branches, affecting sales of IDBI Federal Life policies. For the April 1 to July 31 period (FY21), IDBI Federal collected new business premium of Rs 109.31 crore, showing a year-on-year decrease of 27.5 percent. On August 6, IDBI Bank announced that it will sell 27 percent stake in IDBI Federal to Ageas Insurance International and  Federal Bank  for Rs 595.30 crore. As per the agreement, 23 percent stake would be sold to Ageas, and Federal Bank would acquire up to 4 percent stake from IDBI Bank. The deal valued IDBI Federal Life Insurance at Rs 2,198.15 crore. IDBI Federal Life’s parent IDBI Bank is now owned by LIC, after the state-owned insurer bought 51 percent stake in the bank in January 2019. IDBI Bank currently owns 48 percent in IDBI Federal Life, while Federal Bank and Belgium’s Ageas hold 26 percent each. Once the transaction is completed, IDBI Bank’s stake will come down to 21 percent. Federal Bank will then hold 30 percent and Ageas will hold 49 percent, which is the maximum permissible foreign direct investment in an Indian insurance company. “The uncertainty is now considerably reduced with IDBI Bank giving out its plans to pare down stake in the company. But we have to increase our distribution footprint,” said Shahane. In May 2018, while IDBI Bank was close to a stake sale in the life insurance company, however the deal could not be completed due to valuation concerns. With LIC as the majority shareholder, the stake sale process had to begin afresh. Shahane said on one hand while business from IDBI Bank has almost evaporated, business from Federal Bank has seen an increase of 40 percent despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Right now, Federal Bank contributes about 70 percent of the business for IDBI Federal Life. Green shoots emerging There are early signs of revival being seen in IDBI Federal Life. Despite a drop in new business premium at the end of FY20, the life insurer posted a 11.3 percent YoY increase in net profit at Rs 147.83 crore. When it comes to the new business premium, the life insurer saw a slower rate of decline in July 2020. Data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) showed that IDBI Federal Life had seen a 36.8 percent decline in March and 67.7 percent decline in April in new business premium on a YoY basis. In May 2020, the premium declined by 48.2 percent, and in June the decline was 17.3 percent. However, in July the YoY decline was only 5.2 percent at 45.42 crore. “Our accumulated losses were wiped off (in July 2018). Our focus has been to build the business, but not at the cost of profitability or persistency,” said Shahane. ",companies,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 07:03 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/auto-loans-banks-wary-of-financing-vehicles-as-defaults-rise-5677221.html,Auto loans: Banks wary of financing vehicles as defaults rise,"With the Reserve Bank cautioning against bad loans climbing to 20-year highs, banks and other financial institutions are developing cold feet in lending to the automobile sector. RBI, in a report, said public sector banks’ gross bad loans ratio of 11.3 percent at the end of March may increase to 15.2 percent by March 2021 under the baseline scenario. Private banks may see an increase from 4.2 percent to 7.3 percent. Automobile dealers, especially of trucks, buses, three-wheelers and two-wheelers, have reported extra layers of scrutiny by banks when availing loans in addition to a lower loan amount. Ashish Kale, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Association said, “Banks and NBFCs though flush with high liquidity are still having a cautious approach towards funding auto retail affecting the demand revival especially in segments of CV, 3W and 2W. Vehicle funding percentage has fallen by 10-15 percent in many segments increasing the initial contribution beyond the reach of many customers, despite having the intent to buy.” This is despite almost every carmaker and two-wheeler manufacturer announcing tie-ups with financiers over the past few months to ease the process of availing finance as well as enticing customers. Though the cost of finance has come down it is not at the same pace as the cuts made by the RBI. Shashank Srivastava, Head of Marketing & Sales,  Maruti Suzuki India  said: “Interest rates have come down but not as much as we would have thought they would. The banks are relooking at the credit ratings of the consumer once again. They are reassessing the credit ratings of the consumers."" Auto buyers who put the vehicle for commercial use may be at the bottom of the priority list for banks. Entry-level bikes, three-wheelers (autorickshaw and cargo), cars used as taxis, trucks and buses are the hardest hit. Though some green shoots are visible in segments like construction, mining and road-building, the overall truck utilisation rate at the national level remains poor. This is forcing banks to provide loans with extra caution to the commercial vehicle sector. Speaking to Moneycontrol Satyakam Arya, managing director, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles said: “We have seen banks being more cautious than they used to be. They are also not lending to customers availing moratorium right now. We definitely see this as a constraint in demand creation. But the banks are better positioned to take a call.” ",,"Last Updated : Aug 10, 2020 06:35 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

In July, the two Mumbai-based companies lost their long-held positions to each other, actual vehicle registration data provided by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) show. Passenger vehicle segment Tata Motors displaced M&M in the passenger vehicle (car, SUV and van) segment to grab the third spot, behind Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. M&M was pushed down to the fourth spot. Tata Motors saw 12,753 registrations for its PVs in July, resulting in a market share of 8.10 percent (6.07 percent in July 2019). In comparison, M&M saw 7,811 registrations and a share of 4.96 percent in July (8.47 percent in July 2019). Deliveries of the new model, Altroz, and the restyled range of Bharat Stage VI models such as Nexon and Tiago pushed volumes for Tata Motors. Speaking to analysts, Shailesh Chandra, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, said: “Production could only restart in a proper manner in June. And post that, we have steeply ramped up in July to service very strong demand”. M&M officials blamed a fire at one of its headlamp and tail-lamp suppliers for crippling production of some models, including the Marazzo and XUV300. Speaking to analysts Rajesh Jejurikar, M&M’s Additional Director & Executive Director,  Automotive and Farm Sectors, said: “We had to start prioritising models after the lockdown. Given the strong rural pull we had started prioritizing the Scorpio and Bolero. So some of our models haven't even got out yet — that's all pent-up (demand) and for Marazzo, XUV 300 and XUV 500.” Commercial vehicle segment But the commercial vehicle (CV) space paints a completely different picture. Mahindra snatched the top spot from Tata Motors in the CV segment in July, perhaps for the first time ever, according to FADA data. Tata Motors was the unchallenged leader in the CV segment for several years, mirroring the success of Maruti Suzuki’s dominance in the PV segment. M&M’s market share jumped to 46.29 percent in July (24.75 percent in July 2019) with registrations of 8,930 units. Tata Motors’ market share during the same month nearly halved to 21.03 percent (40.11 percent in July 2019) with registration of 4,058 units. With Mahindra claiming the top spot and Tata Motors pushed down to the second, Ashok Leyland continues in the third spot. “There is an overall increase in rural demand and that is leading to movement of goods and agriculture. So we are seeing a very positive demand for pickups. Small commercial vehicle (SCV) demand is picking up because of the need for last-mile mobility. There is a lot of demand for SCV ambulances and we are struggling to ramp up to requirements,” Jejurikar added. The commercial vehicle category has been even more severely hit than the passenger vehicle segment because of slow national economic momentum. Smaller CVs, which cater to last-mile distribution, are gathering speed but the larger, medium and heavy (M&HCV) truck and bus segment are yet to come out of the woods. “One sees higher demand for last-mile distribution, which is addressed by small commercial vehicles. In terms of demand contraction, it is maximum in medium and heavy commercial trucks as well as buses,” Girish Wagh, President, Commercial Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, told analysts.

The 84 percent drop in domestic cumulative sales of Ashok Leyland till July at 7,691 units as against 48,104 units sold in the same four months last year notwithstanding. “As the governmental measures to reactivate the commercial sector are awaited, the management has taken the opportunity of the last few months to re-examine the business and operating models without any presumptions”, Hinduja said. Besides aggressive cost cutting measures the Chennai-based bus market leader is banking on a complete revamp of its product portfolio for light and medium and heavy commercial vehicle segments complete with the launch of new brands. “Upon a clinical assessment of the short term and long-term prospects, a series of initiatives have been set in motion to reconfigure the company aimed at sustainable growth while minimising the adverse impact of economic cycles,” Hinduja added. Research and ratings provider ICRA has predicted volume shrinkage to 10 year lows in FY21 given the macro-economic headwinds compounded by the pandemic. “Demand headwinds are expected to continue over the near-term given the macroeconomic challenges in view of the pandemic outbreak, coupled with weakening financial profile of fleet operators and significant price hikes because of transition to BS-VI emission norms,"" said ICRA in its report on the CV industry. In June Ashok Leyland launched AVTR claimed to be India’s first modular truck platform which allows up to 6 lakh possible combinations catering to the 18.5-55 tonne segments. The company is now in the process of launching light commercial vehicle platform Phoenix in the current quarter to address a segment where it was not present. The Phoenix has been in the works for more than a year and will cater to the 5-7 tonne segment. “We made a courageous decision to introduce a modular truck platform AVTR for the medium and heavy range. We are now ready with an in-house developed new LCV range whose launch had to be deferred due to the COVID-19 crisis. The introduction is expected to be a game changer just as DOST was,"" Hinduja added. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 11, 2020 09:51 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/bis-standardised-helmets-to-become-mandatory-from-march-1-2021-5683791.html,"BIS standardised helmets to become mandatory from March 1, 2021","With the proposal on standardising helmet quality going back and forth since 2018, there is finally word that manufacturers will now have to comply with BIS norms from March 1, 2021. Termed the ‘Protective Helmet for Two-Wheelers (Quality Control) Order, 2020’, a notification by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) states that all helmets must comply with Bureau of Indian Standards norms by March 1, 2021. While the move to standardise helmet manufacturing is good, it does raise a few questions. Back in 2018 when the norms were first suggested, the ministry ruled that helmets over 1,200 grams would not be allowed to be manufactured, stored or sold in India. While the weight factor does not do much for the Indian standard by itself, international brands who would have even thought of testing for Indian standards, would probably not anymore. This is primarily because international standards call for a higher level of protection making the helmets lighter. For these brands to be able to hit that 1,200 gms mark, their expenses would only rise, thanks to the use of more exotic materials like carbon fibre. Using cheaper materials without compromising on the protective nature of the helmet is almost impossible at that weight. Back in 2018, the notion was side-lined thanks to protests by the motorcycling community. This time, however, while the government is accepting feedback till August 30, the notification reads, “The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, in consultation of Bureau of India Standards, proposes to issue Protective Helmets for two-wheeler riders (Quality Control) Order, 2020 under the powers conferred under section 16, 17 and 25 of the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 2016 to bring Protective Helmets for two wheelers rider under compulsory certification under Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 2016.” The problem is there is no mention of whether the new norms will come with or without that weight restriction, but maybe that will become clear in the days to come.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/diesel-segment-to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-question-for-auto-majors-5693991.html,"Diesel segment: To be or not to be, that is the question for auto majors","Korean twins Hyundai and Kia have seen no let-up in demand for diesel engine-powered variants of the Creta and Seltos, respectively. Three out of every five new Cretas (65,000 bookings since March 2020) and one in every two Seltos units sold are powered by diesel engines. Again, warhorses Scorpio and Bolero, made by SUV-specialist Mahindra & Mahindra, continue to generate significant demand in rural markets. Neither has a petrol option. And India’s third-largest carmaker Tata Motors has committed to produce diesel options as long as there is demand for them. Contrarian view But not every passenger vehicle maker is swayed by this trend, particularly car market leader Maruti Suzuki. With the onset of Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms from April 1, Maruti Suzuki totally abandoned the diesel category. The maker of Swift and Baleno believes that diesel variants would become unaffordably expensive for the compact car buyer. Speaking to analysts, Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director, Maruti Suzuki India, said: “Diesel’s share was about 20.6 percent in Q1 as against 29.5 percent in FY20. Maruti Suzuki, of course, is at 0 percent because we don't have diesel (models). And as far as the competition is concerned, they are at 36 percent”. Running cost factor Maruti Suzuki’s belief has been strengthened by the rise in the price of diesel in recent days, almost to the petrol price level. “It does not make economic sense to have a diesel car if the criteria is running cost as it is roughly similar at about Rs 4/km for both. There is no economic logic in buying a diesel vehicle because of the large difference in acquisition cost and a very low difference or none at all in the running cost,” said Srivastava. “There are some segments like the mid-SUV and above, where buyers are still looking for diesel because their preference is torque rather than economic requirements. And that is why we have said that Maruti Suzuki is also looking very closely to evaluate whether it requires to be present in the larger diesel category,” Srivastava added. “There has been an increase in the upfront price differential of Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000, post BS-VI implementation, which, along with narrowing fuel price gap, is accelerating this shift to petrol and CNG,” said rating agency ICRA. The increase is over and above the Rs 1 lakh-1.25 lakh premium there was before BS-VI implementation. “Diesel’s share in PVs is expected to decline to 15-18 percent in FY2022 from 29 percent in FY2020. Within this, the share of diesel vehicles in the car segment will stabilize around 5-7 percent (from 11 percent), whereas the UV segment’s share will gradually reduce to sub 40 percent (from 65 percent) over the next 2-3 years”, ICRA added. The end of BS-IV norms brought the curtains down on Maruti Suzuki’s diesel bouquet: the Brezza, S-Cross, Swift, Baleno, Ertiga, Dzire and Ciaz models. The company currently offers a pure petrol engine option or a petrol+CNG option. But Maruti’s competition is not letting this opportunity go away. Filling the void Hyundai’s compact SUV Venue, which takes Maruti’s Brezza head-on, is sating the consumer appetite for diesel. One third of Venue’s sales are made up of diesel engines. Brezza’s other competitor, Mahindra XUV300, has also not witnessed much change in diesel demand. Rajesh Jejurikar, Additional Director & Executive Director of Automotive and Farm Sectors, M&M, said: “On the rural side, we are not seeing any consumer desire to move to gasoline in the segments we participate in. In the urban market, especially in the compact SUV segment, where we have XUV300, about 35-40 percent  is gasoline. So, there is some shift on the urban side. But on the rural side, and products like Scorpio and Bolero, the customer continues to have a distinct preference for diesel”. Kia’s new launch Sonet, which will hit the market in a few weeks, will also have a diesel engine option. The Sonet, too, will go head-to-head with the Maruti Brezza. Sources in Kia Motors say that the diesel composition of the Sonet is expected to be north of 30 percent. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 11:18 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

A letter sent to the transport department and transport commissioners of all states and Union Territories by the Centre on August 12 stated: “The government is striving to create an ecosystem to accelerate the uptake of electric mobility in the country. It is time to come together to work jointly to achieve the broader national agenda to reduce vehicular pollution and oil import bill. It will also provide opportunities to the sunrise industry.” The batteries in an electric vehicle (EV) make up 30-40 percent of the total cost of the vehicle. The government hopes that the upfront cost of the vehicle will thus be lower than petrol, diesel or CNG powered two and three-wheelers. “The battery could be provided separately by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or the energy service provider,” the letter added. Naveen Munjal, Managing Director, Hero Electric said, “The policy is a welcome move. I am excited about the possibilities that exist in making EVs accessible to every individual in the country. All we need is a combination of such pioneering policies for it to work in the long term.” “For this to take off and be able to efficiently pass on the benefit to the consumer, we ought to work towards a strong infrastructure that allows EV owners to charge and swap batteries wherever they require. I look forward to more such positive interventions,"" Munjal added. The prototype of the EV and the battery (regular or swappable) is required to be type approved by test agencies specified by the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. “It is clarified that vehicles without batteries can be sold and registered based on the type approval certificate issued by the test agency. It is further clarified that there is no need to specify the make/type or any other details of the battery for the purpose of registration,” the Centre’s letter added.

We are trying to figure out exactly which segment is the right segment for us. Electric is something we take very seriously.” Eicher Motor -owned Royal Enfield is the leader in the 350cc and above bike segment in India with brands such as Classic, Himalayan and Interceptor. The company is the first from its industry to share plans about electric motorcycles. “It is not about whether electric (mobility) will come or not but it’s a question of ‘when’.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/explained-why-did-the-govt-remove-batteries-to-boost-ev-sales-5696361.html,"Why were sales of electric two- and three-wheelers without batteries allowed, will buyers benefit and other questions answered","Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are not gaining steam in the country, despite launching two incentive schemes in five years. In FY20, 152,000 electric two-wheelers were sold in India, which was less than 1 percent of the 17.5 million sold during the same year, globally. That scenario could now change with the government,  on August 12, bringing about a landmark change  to the buying structure of an electric two- and three-wheeler. Moneycontrol  brings you the likely impact of the new government policy on EVs. What is the change brought about by the government? The government has allowed the registration of electric two- and three-wheelers without batteries. It has written to the transport commissioners and the transport departments of states and Union Territories to allow the registrations. Why has this been done? Batteries account for up to 40 percent of the EV cost. So, the price of an EV with battery deters it from becoming a mass product. The government believes if the cost of batteries is removed from the price equation, it would bring down the acquisition price of EVs and trigger demand. Who will provide the batteries then? The government’s move can give birth to a new tier in the supply chain of electric vehicles. Third party vendors focussing only on supplying batteries could gain prominence. Batteries can be given on hire or sold as per choice. Battery, as an asset, will be on the books of the vendor. It will also become easier for the government to source end-of-life batteries from a common place for disposal. How can buyers benefit? Battery contains the fuel for an electric vehicle. Consumers will now have a choice -- whether to buy a battery-fitted vehicle or not. If the cost of batteries is separated from the EV, its price could decline by 30-40 percent. Interestingly, in 2018, in the swappable battery technology developed by Ashok Leyland and Sun Mobility for electric buses, batteries were not part of the acquisition cost. This made the price much lower than other electric buses. However, their proposal never got the go-ahead from the government. How will it affect manufacturers? China is the world’s biggest manufacturer of EV batteries. Given the geo-political friction between India and China, India cannot afford a disruption in supply of batteries, if the country has to achieve mass electric mobility. With the new policy, manufacturers will be freed from the hassle of procuring batteries, most of which are imported. Vehicle makers can focus on developing new technologies and products for the future. Will this boost EV sales in India? If the price of electric two and three-wheelers head south by 30-40 percent, it will bring their prices on par with petrol, diesel or CNG-powered vehicles, thereby boosting demand. For instance, India’s largest selling scooter, Honda Activa, is priced around Rs 80,000 (on-road) while the fully electric Ather 450 is priced around Rs 115,000, a premium of 44 percent. Will this affect government subsidy? Officially, the government has not provided any guidance or indication. Under the FAME 2 (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles) scheme, the government provides a subsidy ranging from Rs 18,000 to Rs 68,000 for two and three-wheelers.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-mughal-era-gold-coins-5702581.html,The curious case of the missing Mughal era gold coins,"New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has reopened the curious case of India’s missing gold coins which were smuggled out of the country in the late 1970s. Highly placed sources said the Indian government has now got definite proof about the location of one of the two missing coins and has pushed the country’s premier investigating agency to take a fresh relook at the case. The CBI will follow leads once offered by the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) which investigated the case in the 1980s after LP  Sihare, the director general of National Gallery of Modern Art, had red flagged an attempt by a private party to auction coins in Switzerland and apprised the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi about the national property being stolen. It was Sihare's timely intervention that stopped the 1995 public auction of the jewels of the Nizams, which included the  Jacob Diamond , the world's fifth largest uncut diamond. Little progress was made by the CBI after the CEIB handed over the case. The CBI could not make any headway, ostensibly because no one could tell the agency the exact location of the coins. Magnificent Coins Made of solid gold, the coins are majestic. One weighs 12 kg, beautifully crafted, 21 cm in diameter and the biggest in the world belonging to the Mughal period. The big coin of solid gold is covered with elaborate inscriptions in Persian and Arabic. It was minted in 1613, in the eighth regal year of the emperor, and is thought to be the only one of its kind. The second coin, minted in 1693 during Shah Jehan's reign, is equally ornate. It weighs 1kg, also 21 cm in diameter and belonging to the same period. The coins, put together, would be worth a little over Rs 1,000 crore going by the current gold prices and the antique value. The CBI is now working on leads that the big coin is in a museum in Kuwait and the second one should be with some private owner, possibly in the Middle East or Europe.  Mughal Emperor Jahangir (Image: Wikimedia Commons/Smithsonian Libraries (Freer-Sackler Library) Jahangir’s own autobiography  Tuzk-e-Jahangiri  mentions the big coin. During the reign of Jahangir, the coins minted by his government grew larger and of high value. The larger ones were handed out to important officials who rendered special military services to the state. The big coin was presented by Emperor Aurangzeb to Nawab Ghaziuddin Khan Siddiqui Bahadur, Feroze Jung I, whose son Nizam-ul-Mulk founded the Asaf Jah dynasty. For a little over two centuries, the coin passed from one generation to the next in the Nizam's family before coming into the possession of Prince Mukarram Jah, the titular 8th Nizam, heir and custodian of the incredible wealth of the Asif Jahi rulers. But the coins were not to be found from the vaults of the Nizam family. How the coins were smuggled out The CEIB had then told the Indian government that a top politician carried the coins in his luggage and travelled from Mumbai (then Bombay) to London in the 1970s. Under Indian rules, luggage of the VIPs is not checked like those belonging to common passengers. The CEIB probe found that the conspiracy involved the Nizam's family and senior government officials who assisted the royal family when the coins were removed from the Nizam’s palace and taken out through Bombay Airport. In a rare instance of speedy government action, the Indian embassy in Berne, Switzerland was alerted and the Swiss government informed. The magnificent coins were offered for sale at a private auction by Habsburg, Feldman in Geneva. The coins were  piece de resistance  of the glittering auction at Geneva's Noga Hilton hotel. But the coins were finally not sold because of a last-minute intervention by the Indian Embassy which prevented the sale. But the auctioneer's marketing chief Karin Hellgren told Indian diplomats that negotiations for selling the coins could take place privately with interested parties. He told the Indian official that a private offer of $10 million (about Rs 13 crore) had in fact been made but the mysterious owner of the coins had held out for a higher bid. The buyer, rumoured to be Jah himself, wanted closer to $20 million for the coins. Among those keen on a private offer were Saudi billionaire and arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, Hassanal Bolkiah (the Sultan of Brunei), and Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Socrates Onassis. The CEIB had also informed the government that Mukarram Jah was present in Geneva when the auction was planned. “Without the involvement of top government officials, it was not possible for the coins to be taken out of India,” says Ajay Agnihotri, the former Assistant Director General of Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), who assisted then CEIB director, ML Wadhawan, in investigating the case. Now, the Indian government is keen to get the coins back because it genuinely believes the coins were smuggled out of India and is in the possession of some private collector. Also Read:   Bitter fight erupts in Haldiram's group over property after death of family elder Mukarram Jah, the grandson of the seventh Nizam and his chief beneficiary and successor-in-title, had informed the Indian government that the coins were taken away by the British before India gained independence, probably around 1945-46. He did not say who took the coins away. But the CEIB was convinced Jah was lying. Jah, who was shuttling between the UK, Turkey and Australia, was interrogated by officials of Australian Customs twice in the presence of CEIB director Wadhawan. The CEIB informed the Finance Ministry—then headed by SB Chavan— that the coins left India in the 70s and Jah got possession of the coins in London. But during his interrogation in Australia, Jah repeatedly denied any knowledge of the coins. “If the CBI manages to locate the coins, it will be a big one because I remember the furore which took place when newspapers carried reports of the big coin being auctioned in Switzerland many years ago. I haven’t heard anything after that,” says Mohan Guruswamy, a former advisor to the finance ninister in the late 1990s and currently a political and economic analyst. Guruswamy says the search could be tough unless Mukarram Jah, the principal heir of the riches of the last Nizam, agrees to open up. Jah, who currently lives abroad, had returned to India for a brief period in 2013 and was faced with numerous cases filed against him by the CBI and Hyderabad Police for his alleged role in selling off the coins. Jah told the investigators that he had come to India to clear some of his staggering debts in India, Switzerland, and Australia, his home for the last 18 years. On a conservative estimate, his total wealth in India alone hovered around Rs 50 crore in 2013. “Jah never kept his slate clean. There was a mountain of charges against him,” says Agnihotri, adding it was the mismanagement of properties in India that made Jah attempt to auction the two coins. “No one knows how the coins reached a Geneva bank vault. The sale did not go through because the Indian government intervened before the bids - details of which were advertised in a foreign newspaper - could be opened in Berne,” added Agnihotri. The vaults in Geneva, claim sources in the CBI, were rented by Jah. Around the time when Indian officials were trying their best to stop the auction of the coin, Mukkaram Jah's lawyers argued that the law did not apply to antiquities taken out of India before 1947 and the coins were taken to Paris by his aunt, Nilofar Sultan, before India gained independence. In short, they confessed that the family of Nizam had taken the coins out of India. A global hunt The claim of the lawyers was quite different from that of Jah who had told Indian investigators that the British government had taken away the gold coins before India gained independence. Yet, Jah was there at the sale and was expecting the bid for both coins to reach $14 million. What is interesting is that Jah still managed to  borrow Rs 9.82 crore from a Swiss Bank to be returned with interest, totalling Rs 10.06 crore, by March 1989. When Jah failed to pay up, the courts were moved to freeze his assets in India and Switzerland. “And then, the coins went missing,” said Agnihotri. If the whereabouts are known, the Indian government would rightfully demand return of the coins since the coins were smuggled out of India and such articles must be returned as per international conventions. “The case was handed over to the CBI by CEIB long back. And the file has not been closed. We are working on various leads to get a firm grip on the location of the coins,” a senior CBI official said on conditions of anonymity. “The Museum of IsIamic Art in Kuwait lists such a coin and claims it is the world’s biggest. If it is the same coin, then the CBI must probe how the coin reached there. And what happened to the other coin weighing over 1 kilo,” says Agnihotri. The CBI, it is reliably learnt, would seek help from Interpol to further its probe. One side of the probe is to locate the coins, the second side is to find out if a Swiss Court cleared the sale of the coins because its owner failed to clear debts. The Swiss Court decided on the case in 2006. Unfortunately, Indian Government never became a party to the case and was not even sent a copy of the Judgment. Interestingly, details of the judgement are with the Swiss government and also with the Cambridge University’s archives. The CBI will have to make efforts to get a copy of this judgment to ascertain India’s status up the vis-a-vis the coins. The search for the coins will bring Jah in focus again. Historians in Hyderabad, however, have a different story to narrate. They claim the coins left Indian shores long before the country gained Independence. “It will be great if the coins can be brought back. I do not ascribe to the story that the coins were smuggled out of India in the 70s. The coins left long before 1947 and Mukarram Jah got it back from his aunt because he needed cash badly,” claimed Mohammed Saif Ullah, seasoned historian and a member of the protocol team of the Telangana government. Saif Ullah, who had imported a catalogue of the auction from Switzerland, said the coins are someone’s property. “I do not know where the coins are but getting them back will be a tough call.” The Indian government must prove first that the coins were illegally exported after 1947. There could be other issues as well. Switzerland is not a signatory to the international convention governing such claims. And Switzerland is known for hiding behind its usual policy of non-interference when it comes to trafficking in third world treasures.

Further, the ministry of home affairs also said in its affidavit that exams were permitted for final year students taking into account the academic interests of these candidates. The governments of Delhi and Maharashtra had filed an affidavit in the apex court that they will not be conducting examinations due to the coronavirus outbreak. Abhishek Manu Singhvi who is appearing for a law student in this matter told SC in the hearing that this is a matter of life and health. He added that states like Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Odisha have decided to not conduct exams. Shyam Divan who is appearing for Yuva Sena said the earlier guidelines by UGC had sensitivity and flexibility. He added that this cannot be made mandatory especially where in Maharashtra some colleges have become quarantine facilities. ""You cannot say that the lives of a third-year student are less than that of a first-year or second-year student,"" said Divan. He also added that students who don't have access to technology may suffer if exams are made mandatory. Divan questioned that when exams could not be permitted to be held when the confirmed cases in India were in thousands in April, then how can they be allowed to be held now with cases being in lakhs. On July 31, SC had adjourned the matter pertaining to the plea against the University Grants Commission (UGC) decision on mandatorily conducting final year examinations till August 10. Also Read:   What is the plea in SC against the UGC all about? On July 7, UGC said the end-term examination for all final-year students would have to be mandatorily held by the end of September 2020 in offline (pen & paper), online or blended mode. This was opposed by several state governments like that of Maharashtra, West Bengal as also by final-year university students. SG Tushar Mehta said in the July 27 hearing that out of 818 universities in India, 209 have already completed the examinations while 394 are in the process of completing the examinations. He added that 35 universities have not reached final year exams. ",india,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 01:24 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

But the salaries of chief executives brought in to run the companies are by no means modest. In fact some seasoned hands get paid more than the promoter or the chairman of the company himself, data from annual reports show. Guenter Butschek and N Chandrasekaran For instance, the pay package of Daimler veteran Guenter Butschek, who is the Managing Director and CEO of  Tata Motors ,  is the second highest in the non-promoter category in the automotive  industry in India. At Rs 19.27 crore (subject to shareholder approval), Butschek’s salary is higher than chairman N Chandrasekaran’s salary. Chandrasekaran, a non-executive director on the board, received only Rs 4.8 lakh as fees for attending board/committee meetings. As the Chairman of Tata Sons, Chandrasekaran is also on the board of several other Tata Group companies. Pawan Goenka and Anand Mahindra Likewise  Mahindra & Mahindra  Managing Director Pawan Goenka received Rs 10 crore in remuneration in FY20. This was higher than M&M Chairman Anand Mahindra’s pay of Rs 8.71 crore during the same year. The 65-year-old Goenka, who is credited as being the brain behind the Scorpio, M&M’s most recognised SUV, will hang up his boots by the end of FY21. Vinod Dasari and Siddhartha Lal Vinod Dasari tops the list of highest paid executives from the non-promoter category in the Indian automotive space. In FY20, the former Managing Director of  Ashok Leyland  took on the role of steering Royal Enfield, as its Chief Executive Officer. Dasari, who is also a whole-time director at  Eicher Motors,  received a remuneration of Rs 24.6 crore for FY20. This was higher than the remuneration received by promoter and Managing Director Siddhartha Lal, who got Rs 19.41 crore during the same year. Vipin Sondhi and Dheeraj Hinduja  Vipin Sondhi, former Managing Director of JCB India, the leader in the earth-moving segment, was appointed the MD and CEO of Ashok Leyland, India’s biggest manufacturer of buses, in mid-December 2019. His remuneration for 100 days (December to March) amounted to Rs 2.22 crore, which was higher than Chairman Dheeraj Hinduja’s full year remuneration of Rs 1.16 crore. Sondhi was also granted 7.01 million stock options in FY20. Promoters who are also the lead executives in their companies witnessed a healthy increase  in pay during FY20. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director,  Bajaj Auto,  saw his remuneration climb 23 percent to nearly Rs 40 crore. Pawan Munjal, Chairman and Managing Director,  Hero MotoCorp , saw his pay package rise to nearly Rs 85 crore, an increase of 5 percent during FY20. Kenichi Ayukawa: A picture of contrast  The remuneration of  Maruti Suzuki  Managing Director Kenichi Ayukawa stood at Rs 4.66 crore for FY20. This pales in comparison to other executives at the same level in the auto industry, despite Maruti Suzuki’s operations being far bigger than most others. For instance, Maruti Suzuki clocked revenues of Rs 79,000 crore and a profit of Rs 5,650 crore during FY20. During the same year, Eicher Motors clocked revenue of Rs 9,153 crore and a profit of Rs 1,827 crore. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 10:32 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Morrison said the ""deep friendship"" between Australia and India was about more than trade and diplomacy. ""Founded on Bharosa (trust) and Samman (respect) – it is a friendship with depth, and marked by democracy, defence cooperation, diaspora and Dosti (friendship), '' the prime minister said. ""Australia joins wholeheartedly in its celebration of independence and extends our warm congratulations to the people of India,"" he said.

""As I said during the visit to Australia of President Kovind: Our cultures might be different, but we believe in similar things. We believe in the supremacy of the ballot-box in our national life; in the rule of law; in institutions that safeguard rights; and the responsibility of free people to build a better world,"" Morrison said in a statement. ""It is because of our shared values, interests, and objectives that Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and I announced the historic elevation of bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in June this year,"" he said.

The agency had recently noted that the fiscal deficit of central and state governments will come at 12.1 percent, with the states contributing 4.5 percent of it. ""An increase in central and state government fiscal deficit in FY21 can impact both order inflow and collection in the sector,"" India Ratings said in a release. After almost three months of the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, the country entered the unlock mode from June 1, with the government lifting restrictions gradually and almost all economic activities resuming from July. The agency said revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins of engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies would decline around 15 percent and 200 basis points, respectively, this fiscal as against FY20, as the lockdowns would reduce the project execution pace.

""Players with focus on road, building and metro registered significant growth in their order book during FY16-FY19,"" India Rating said. The agency noted that while growth in the road segment was supported by government plans to increase the pace of road construction in the country to 30 km per day in FY19 from 15-16 km per day in FY16, the building and housing segment was supported by Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY) scheme. ""Players with focus on housing and metro projects registered significant growth in FY20.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/as-britain-climbs-out-of-an-economic-pit-tough-questions-loom-5703811.html,"As Britain climbs out of an economic pit, tough questions loom","To understand why Britain has spiraled into the deepest recession of its modern history, go for a stroll in central London, no longer a ghost town but still a shadow of its once-bustling self. Shuttered storefronts pock the shopping promenade on Oxford Street. Theaters in the West End are dark, office towers deserted. Below ground, the tube is a grim parade of signs warning passengers to wear face masks and keep their distance. With traffic at barely a quarter of last year’s levels, that is not hard. Only restaurants, buoyed by a government stimulus program that subsidizes diners’ meals, are showing signs of life. But like the government’s widely praised furlough program that guaranteed 80% of the salaries of millions of workers, the “Eat Out to Help Out” promotion will soon wind down, and the government faces tough choices about whether to extend the support. Unquestionably, Britain has been laid low by the coronavirus, easily the hardest hit of any European nation, both in public health and the economy. “What we’re grappling with is something that is unprecedented, and we don’t have a playbook for how to deal with it,” the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, told the BBC on Wednesday after the Office of National Statistics reported that the economy shrank by an unheard-of 20.4% in the second quarter. That was the deepest quarterly decline of any major European country, and it prompted a fresh round of hand-wringing in Britain, which has also earned the unwelcome distinction of running up the highest death toll from the coronavirus in Europe, with more than 51,000 fatalities. In part, Britain’s dire economic numbers reflect a quirk of timing: Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown a week later than most of his European neighbors and lifted the restrictions later as well. That means Britain sustained more damage in the second quarter than France, Italy or Germany, which began reopening during that period. But Britain’s economic woes are also linked to its broader ordeal with the virus. Because its outbreak was so widespread, prolonged and deadly, economists said, the fear of contagion continues to be higher in Britain than elsewhere. Despite the government’s urging, people have yet to resume normal lives, particularly in cities like London, where working from home is an alternative for many. Google, which uses cellphone signals to track foot traffic to offices, shops, restaurants and transit stations, shows that commercial activity in Britain has trailed Germany, France, Italy and Spain since mid-May, though the gap has begun to narrow. “If you have a massive outbreak, people are going to respond by being cautious and it will take a while for confidence to return,” said John Springford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute. “It makes sense that London is going to be among the hardest hit places.” For all its talk about reopening, Britain still has the strictest set of restrictions in place of any major European country, according to Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government, which tracks the stringency of government-imposed restrictions, from schools and workplace closings to travel bans. It is even more locked down than Spain, which has recently seen a spike in infections that prompted the British government to impose a 14-day quarantine on people who traveled there and returned to Britain. Like Spain, Britain is particularly vulnerable to a sudden decline in consumption because its economy is more dependent on services, including tourism and hospitality, than those of Germany or France. Economists said it was no accident that Spain’s second-quarter contraction, at 18.5%, was closest to that of Britain. The German economy, with its extensive industrial base, shrank by 10.1% while France’s fell 13.8%. None of this eases the pressure on Johnson’s government, which has come under harsh scrutiny for its handling of the pandemic. Until now, its economic measures have insulated people from the sudden dislocation of losing their livelihoods. But Sunak insisted the government will stop subsidizing wages altogether at the end of October. He has so far resisted fierce pressure from the opposition and other critics to soften his stand. “A downturn was inevitable after lockdown, but Johnson’s jobs crisis wasn’t,” said Anneliese Dodds, the Labour Party’s shadow chancellor, who said the government must continue targeted support for vulnerable workers. Sunak contends the government cannot guarantee wages indefinitely because some jobs are never going to come back after the pandemic. Encouraging people to look for new jobs is vital to giving them a sustainable future. Still, a huge spike in the unemployment rate will be hard for Johnson’s Conservative government to withstand, especially since it ran on a platform of bringing prosperity to Britain’s industrial north. The drumbeat of job losses is already underway: On Tuesday, troubled department store chain Debenhams announced 2,500 job cuts on top of a previously announced 4,000. Critics said it was unreasonable for the government to force people back into the job market when Britain’s test, trace and isolate system was not robust enough to give them confidence that they can move around safely. That is particularly true in parts of the country like Leicester and Greater Manchester that have suffered fresh outbreaks and have been put under local lockdowns. “The government has taken a one-size-fits-all approach to ending the job retention program,” said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, a London research institute. “But the economic response has to be targeted to where the economy is hardest hit.” Sunak has tried to do that with “Eat Out to Help Out,” a 500 million-pound ($654 million) program to bolster the beleaguered restaurant industry by subsidizing the meals of customers by up to 10 pounds ($13) per person. As of Aug. 9, the government said people had bought 10.5 million meals using the incentive. At the German Gymnasium, a cavernous restaurant next to Kings Cross railroad station, the promotion drew a respectable crowd Tuesday night — comparable, General Manager Sam Bernard said, to a weekend night. He said his only request would be for the government to extend it to Thursday night. Like most restaurants, the German Gymnasium faces murky prospects. It depends on business from Google and Facebook, which have offices nearby. But both companies have told their employees they can work from home until at least next summer. And the government’s subsidy ends on Aug. 31. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 03:37 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

These projects, according to the report, include a plan for a high-tech and environment-friendly ‘naya’ Srinagar and ‘naya’ Jammu. The Prime Minister, the report states, is personally monitoring these proposed projects, the final blueprint of which is being worked on jointly by the Ministry of Urban Development and Jammu and Kashmir administration. The plan, the report suggests, also includes a project to restore the glory of the iconic Dal Lake. ""The area around Dal Lake is densely populated and its glory has diminished over the years. The threat of pollution and large-scale tourism have made it fragile and caused environment degradation. Further, there have been encroachments around the Lake. So, the plan will include reducing the heavy burden from the area around it,"" a source told the newspaper. Sources also said that PM Modi was particular that the new city should be built with attention to the culture of Srinagar, its architecture and aesthetic values while also managing to be a ""sustainable high-tech city"".

It said the seating arrangement has been made under the guiding principle of “Do Gaz ki Doori” (maintaining distance of two yards) between any two guests. It said members of the guard of honour have been under quarantine. ""With an eye on safety, NCC (National Cadet Corps) cadets have been invited to witness the event (instead of young school children) and they will be seated at Gyanpath,"" it noted.

Half-yearly trends show that even with the coronavirus outbreak disrupting business plans, funds have continued to flow for fintechs, which include startups leveraging technology to offer lending, payments and other financial services ,  though at a slower pace. And, if the trend holds, this year could end up being better than 2019, which saw ​ 73 deals amounting to $831 million in the first six months. The report Indian Fintechs vs The Crisis, An Overview of Investment Trends was shared by The Fintech Meetup exclusively with Moneycontrol. The Fintech Meetup was started by a former top executive of Visa Abhishant Pant to bring fintech startups together. It runs three programmes The Fintech Yatra, a fintech masterclass to help budding entrepreneurs and an angel network for the early-stage fund. Lending leads the pack Lending startups grabbed the largest share of deals, with $814 million funding followed by $240 million for payments firms. The largest funding round happened in Sachin Bansal-promoted Navi, which got a $400 million in 2020. Insurance startup Digit with $84 million was next, followed by BharatPe, a digital payments player for small merchants, which got $75 million funding. The report relies on publicly disclosed investment figures and corporate filings for the first six months of 2020. Most of these deals were announced after the viral outbreak in the country but could have been stitched at the beginning of the year. India reported its first coronavirus case on January 30 and after a lull of more than a month, reports of sporadic infections started coming in and on March 24 a nationwide lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the disease. Among the cities, Bengaluru continues to be the startup destination, with 31 fintechs based in the city getting funded compared to Mumbai getting 22 deals and Gurugram 11. The year 2020 seems to be going better not only in terms of the number of deals but also funding value that has gone up 57 percent over last year. The report says financial inclusion space has the potential to attract more investments and early signs point to that. Companies in the financial inclusion space received $19 million in 2020 compared to only $4 million in 2019. Deal-making trends  There was a considerable uptick in deals of up to $5 million and beyond $20 million. Investments in the range of $10-20 million saw a 33 percent decline compared to last year. Above $50 million deals grew to seven this year against five during the same period last year. Two big bang rounds in the $100 million-plus category were driven by Navi Technologies, which received funding from angels and its founders, and PhonePe that is backed by its parent entity, Flipkart. At a time when B2B startups are being hailed as revenue-generating businesses, the report found that 60 percent of the deals were cornered by consumer-facing startups. A total of $948 million was pumped into this space, the report says. The figures were skewed by the mega funding round of Navi. Without the $400-million deal, the second quarter funding would have fallen 13 percent compared to last year, the report says. “Setting Navi aside, investments are still at par with a slight increase…given the instability brought on by COVID, I'd say the discount on funding growth is a given. So it seems like a resilient indicator that deal flow has not fallen below last H1's funding,” said Pant, founder, The Fintech Meetup. Pant is an angel investor himself . Coinvesting is another theme that pops out, given the pandemic and the uncertainties around the economic slowdown, deal makers looked for more participants for the big rounds. Agro-finance startup Bijak, for instance, saw the participation of eight co-investors in its $11.8-million round. Gold loan startup Rupeek saw six investors together pumping in $60 million its Series C round. VCs still optimistic Fintech continues to be on the radar of large investors. Rajat Agarwal, director at Matrix Partners India, said the next decade will start with some pain but eventually see massive value creation. “Sceptics should track HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance’s stock price post the 2008 crisis, or note that companies such as Square, Stripe and Sofi started in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively,” he said. Players like Square and Stripe are few of the most successful fintech startups coming out of Silicon Valley. Matrix Partners has funded companies like Mswipe, Razorpay, Avail Finance, Ofbusiness, Jupiter and others. T he COVID impact The April-June quarter saw a 22 percent dip in venture funding, the report says, highlighting a cautious approach adopted by VCs after the pandemic spread in India. Funding moved into the Series A category companies, which needed money to boost operations. Early-stage funding slowed down. Series D and E rounds also saw a marginal increase, showing investor preference for well-established players. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 03:56 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/independence-day-covid-19-prompts-govt-to-usher-in-affordable-rental-housing-complexes-5704591.html,Independence Day: COVID-19 prompts Centre to usher in affordable rental housing complexes,"Anuj Puri From the dawn of independence to today, the Indian real estate sector has come a long way. Yet, the goal of a roof over every Indian's head has never been a more urgent compulsion. As we usher in our 74th year of independence, there is still a long way to go. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need for affordable housing – rental or buy – across the country's cities where most migrant workers come to seek a living. The incumbent government's ‘Housing for All by 2022’ initiative is inching closer to reality. RERA too has made considerable progress. However, the coronavirus pandemic savagely underscored the absence of affordable rental housing in major cities, resulting in a mass exodus of migrants with no income during the lockdown. The government shifted gears on its flagship scheme and included affordable rental housing in it. All states will be asked to develop such products and encourage private partnerships. The move will not just regularise the rental housing market across the country but also add another asset class for developers to consider. - Construction, operation and maintenance of ARHCs by private/ public entities on their own vacant land. To begin with, the government plans to use about one lakh unused housing units built under the JNNURM and the Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) – the previous government’s urban upgrade and housing programmes - to provide rental housing. The monthly rentals for homes under ARHCs are likely to be fixed between Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000. To attract private participation, the government has also rolled out special incentives such as use permission, 50% additional FAR/FSI, concessional loans at priority sector lending rates and tax reliefs at par with affordable housing to develop ARHCs on their own available vacant land for 25 years. However, low yields may be a major deterrent for private participation. While funding for such projects would be at concessional rates, many developers who have bought land at steep prices in the cities earlier on may find the proposition unattractive. Will the government unleash further incentives? The Model Tenancy Act aims to bridge the trust deficit between tenants and landlords by clearly delineating the obligations of tenants and landlords. To ensure speedy redressal of disputes, it also proposes to establish Rent Court and Rent Tribunal that will hear appeals for matters connected to rental housing. This Act can fuel the rental housing supply pipeline by attracting more investors, and more rental housing stock will help students, working professionals and migrant populations to find urban accommodation. A sharp 180 percent rise of project completions was seen between December 2018 and early August 2020 – from 12.58 lakh homes completed back in December 2018 to over 35.18 lakh homes as of August 2020. Of the total homes sanctioned, Andhra Pradesh has the highest number (20.16 lakh homes), followed by Uttar Pradesh with over 15.95 lakh homes and Maharashtra with over 12.34 lakh homes. In terms of completion, out of the total 35.18 lakh houses completed, Uttar Pradesh is top on the list with more than 5.34 lakh homes already completed, followed by Gujarat with 4.22 lakh homes and Maharashtra with 3.44 lakh homes. According to the latest readings on the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoUHA) website: - About 33 states/Union Territories have notified rules under RERA; One North Eastern State (Nagaland) is under process to notify the rules. Rules in UTs of Ladakh will be notified soon. West Bengal has enacted its own legislation, which has been challenged before Supreme Court and MoHUA has filed its affidavit to annul it. - Around 30 states/UTs have set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Regular - 25, Interim - 05). Jammu & Kashmir, Meghalaya and Sikkim have notified the rules but yet to establish Authority. - About 24 states/UTs have set up Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (Regular -16, Interim – 08). (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim are under process to establish). - Regulatory authorities of 26 States/UTs have operationalised their websites under the provisions of RERA. (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Puducherry are under process to operationalise). Meanwhile, the RBI has taken steps that have, to some extent, eased the woes of the sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic. From repo rate cuts to loan moratoriums, and from an infusion of liquidity for NBFCs and HFCs to a one-year extension of the CLSS scheme up to March 2021, there has been considerable action.

The deadline for officers to join the new unified cadre for supervision and regulation at the RBI was  July 31. The RBI hasn’t extended the deadline post July 31, said an RBI official familiar with the development requesting anonymity, adding, only about 5 percent of the proposed 1,500 strength have joined the cadre till now. The initial deadline to opt-in or opt-out of the department was January 31. On account of lack of participation from officers, this deadline was extended till July 31.  The RBI has now launched a survey among officers of supervisory and regulatory division to assess the competency level of officers, the official quoted above said. “This survey isn’t linked to SSRC. But the RBI may be looking at restructuring the new cadre and this survey could be part of that exercise,” said the official. The unified cadre was formed on November 1 last year to strengthen and consolidate the supervision functions, presently scattered across different departments. However, there is a difference of opinion between top management and officers about the effectiveness of the new division. Officers believe the existing infrastructure needs to be strengthened through training instead of creating a new cadre. In a letter dated 25 June  , the RBI Officers' Association (RBOA) had said that the SSRC will adversely impact the central bank's supervisory functions. ""The bank will lose the benefit of drawing upon from the wider pool of talented officials for its supervisory/regulatory functions. At the same time the officers in the cadre would lack the exposure in other area, therefore, there is an urgent need to review the decision related to SSRC,"" the association had said in the letter. The RBI officers were unhappy with the structure of the new department, and cited HR issues such as mobility, lack of promotion opportunities and performance appraisal system. Besides, the RBI officers are concerned with the way recent promotions were done and with the performance management system.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/heres-why-getting-an-import-licence-for-tv-sets-will-not-be-easy-now-5703371.html,Here’s why getting an import licence for TV sets will not be easy now,"Don’t be surprised if some ‘colour’ would be missing this festive season. High-end television sets of 80 inches and above, which are imported, could be missing from stores and e-commerce platforms during the sale season that will begin September-end. Sources told  Moneycontrol  that after a  July 30 notification  by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), which placed import of colour televisions of all sizes in the restricted category, import licence would be granted only to select brands. “The idea is to ensure that brands produce television sets locally. If ever applicant gets a licence, the ‘Make in India’ mission will be defeated,” said an official. Almost 60 percent of the annual TV sales in India take place during the September-December festive season, mainly because of the heavy discounts and product launches. Also Read:  Here's what boycotting Chinese goods is tough Who imports colour TV sets to India? Large-screen TV sets (80 inches and above) are imported by brands like TCL, Samsung, LG, Xiaomi and Sony, since there is no local manufacturing capacity in India. TCL India Country Manager Mike Chen told  Moneycontrol  that the brand has applied for a licence to import large-screen TVs. TV is one of the larger segments under the entire domain of Appliance and Consumer Electronics, accounting for almost 17 million units, with an estimated worth of almost Rs 25,000 crore. About 30 percent televisions sold in India are imported from countries like China and Vietnam. The government move is to indigenise the production of televisions and lower the reliance on imports. Why can’t companies set up manufacturing units in India? Setting up a manufacturing facility can cost Rs 50 crore- Rs 100 crore. Even if companies are willing, red-tapism leads to inordinate delays in setting up facilities, industry sources said. The easier route, therefore, is to import. Also, the skill sets and equipment for making high-end sets are different from those for 32-inch and 40-inch TV sets. “It cannot be said both can be produced in one factory. The raw materials have to be fully imported as there are no manufacturing facilities for the panels and internal parts in India. “Instead of us importing all parts and merely assembling TV sets here, isn’t it logical to completely import them?” said the head of television business at a white goods firm. How does import licence work? The DGFT had said in July that the import of colour TV sets has been moved to the 'restricted' category from the ‘free’ category. Now, any company that wants to import a colour TV set has to secure a special licence. Once a candidate applies for a licence, there will be a series of checks initially to verify the credentials of the brand. “If it is an established brand in the Indian market for 4-5 years, it will be considered. If it is a new brand, details about the financial strength of the company and the need to import will be sought,” said a government official. For established brands, there will be no credential-checking. However, details on the need to import will be sought. The list of manufacturing facilities in India and the cumulative investment in these entities will also be sought. Post this, the company management will be required to explain why the existing manufacturing capacities cannot be used to produce the TV sets here instead of importing them. Once the details on the need to import are collected, the documents will be further reviewed. For brands that do not have any manufacturing facility in India, clarification will be sought from the company management on the reasons for this and whether they have any future plan for setting up India production plants. “We understand that it will be a lengthy process but are hoping that the products reach us by the end of October. Else, the festive season will be a washout,” said the chief distribution officer at a consumer durables firm. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 04:11 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-festive-season-is-around-the-corner-and-heres-what-brand-experts-are-telling-apparel-retailers-5703451.html,The festive season is around the corner and here’s what brand experts are telling apparel retailers,"Over the last few months, the retail industry has undergone a radical transformation, as the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and Lockdowns took hold. No one could possibly have been prepared for the disruption that was caused. Now, with the festive season around the corner, apparel retailers are turning to brand experts for advice on how to recover from their losses and capitalise on the traditional shopping period. Several sectors are opening up gradually and retailers are hoping for a revival in consumption and some recovery at least in the second quarter of the year or around Diwali. Unlock 1, 2, and 3 have brought some relief to the retail sector. But it is still far from business as usual. Though 85 percent of the retail space is now operational, customers are still sceptical about going out to shop. ‘Go to the customer’ “The biggest concern for retailers is whether customers will come if the market opens up completely and whether they will be keen to shop. Retailers are not able to gauge the customer’s mind. So, we are advising them: ‘If the customer does not come to you go to the customer,’” said N. Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company. Sure enough, with the pandemic and lockdown leading to a surge in online shopping, retail brands are experimenting with newer ways to reach customers via various online and social media platforms. Brands are even evaluating hybrid models that will let them service shoppers in a given city or neighbourhood. One recent trend has brands conducting business and engaging with customers real-time on WhatsApp. Launched in 2009, WhatsApp has 400 million users in India, which is its largest market in the world. Footwear brands Bata India and Metro Brands Ltd are reaching out to customers via Whatsapp. Bata India allows customers to remotely interact and shop from their neighbourhood stores by interacting with store managers, who share catalogues of curated collections on the app. Once the customer selects the items s/he wants, payment and delivery is organised by the store manager locally. Several retail brands are also luring shoppers by sharing links to their websites on WhatsApp. Anticipating a recovery Brand experts and retailers believe the festive season will help restore sales to at least 50 percent of their pre-Covid levels. In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, J. Suresh, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Arvind Fashions Ltd, had said that the company is eyeing the festive season for a pick-up in demand. He added that ‘normalcy in sales will come but not completely.’ “We are not going to get growth immediately, as it is not going to be a buoyant time due to erosion in income, but we believe that at least 50 percent of normalcy in sales will come back during festivals,” he said. ‘Get back to the basics’ Experts feel apparel retailers must get back to the basics to garner a strong response and regain the lost charm of the industry. “Display hunger. Get back to the basics of good retailing practices. Act small. Think small. The high-street store is back in action. So is the kirana. Focus on every customer.  Build back business with this focus brick by brick, Customer by customer, said Harish Bijoor Brand guru and founder, Harish Bijoor Consults Inc. A report from rating agency Crisil Ltd had in a separate report said that the overall apparel retail market could see business dip by 30-35 percent this fiscal year “because of temporary store closures, restricted mobility, and low-income visibility for consumers”. Crisil said demand is expected to recover to pre-lockdown levels only during the October-December festive season. Brand experts are also advising retailers to strengthen their e-commerce presence ahead of Diwali and Christmas. “Apparel is not a very high investment item. Shopping apparel also gives a personal sense of pleasure. Men and women have spent most of the time during the lockdown in loungewear.  So, in the festive season, customers would definitely want variety and buy apparel but may not go to a mall and instead opt to shop online,” Chandramouli said. ‘Increase ad spends’ Since business had come to a complete standstill in the last few months due to the lockdown, retailers had cut their ad spends, saving reserves for expansion. Now, the retailers are being encouraged to increase their advertising spends around September and October to lure customers. According to brand experts, the focus should be on digital, as it is a useful medium for advertisements, since most people in the apparel industry’s target audience have access to the medium. According to Statista, in 2019, India's retail sector spent over 50 percent of its advertising budget on print ads, followed by 20 percent on digital media. The sector increased its spending on digital media that year, while it decreased expenditure on television media. The lockdown, which started from March 22, has been extended to August 31 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Flights and other transport services across the country remain restricted.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hindalco-md-says-cautiously-optimistic-about-demand-rebound-5703731.html,Hindalco MD says cautiously optimistic about demand rebound,"Hindalco Industries  is cautiously optimistic of a demand rebound for its products as the economy begins to find its foot post the COVID-19 led lockdown. While the second quarter has seen many of its customers resuming production, demand from auto and construction - excluding those driven by government spending - continue to lag, said Managing Director Satish Pai. ""Demand has picked up well in sectors such as packaging, industrials and pharmaceuticals. In auto, the two-wheeler segment is doing well,"" Pai said, during the conference on August 14. Better demand will help the aluminium major improve upon its first-quarter performance. Hindalco  reported a net loss of Rs 40 crore  on a standalone basis for June quarter as revenue was hit by COVID-19-led lockdown. The company had reported profit at Rs 23 crore for June quarter 2019. Standalone revenue in Q1 FY21 declined 26.2 percent to Rs 7,420 crore compared to the same period last year. Weak domestic demand had seen the company exporting 80 percent of its production in the first quarter. This should come down to 60 percent in the second quarter, said Pai. The company had continued to operate its smelters at 90 percent capacity during the lockdown, helping it to ship products overseas. At the same time,  the inventory remains high and a better domestic demand will be critical to bringing it down. Globally, a sharp rebound in China - the largest consumer of the metal - has helped prices trend higher. A Reuters report said Fitch Solutions has revised its three-month LME aluminium average price forecast for 2020 to $1,690 a tonne from $1,600 earlier. Pai noted that the prices were moving up because of better sentiment, especially driven by the demand from the Chinese market, where auto sales have recovered smartly. ""The prices are right now driven by sentiment, and not by fundamentals of aluminium demand and supply,"" Pai said. Capex plans On a consolidated basis, Hindalco reported a loss of Rs 709 crore, as compared to a profit of Rs 1,063 crore in the same period last year. This was because of exceptional expenses including those related to the Aleris acquisition by Novelis, the North American unit of Hindalco. Novelis completed the acquisition of Aleris on April 14, 2020, and the integration process has begun, Hindalco said. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 04:46 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The San Francisco-based home sharing company, on August 12, said it is initiating legal proceedings against a guest who held an unauthorized party at a home in Sacramento County, California, last weekend. Three people were shot and wounded at the party. Airbnb wouldn't release the guest's name but said it has removed the guest from its platform. The company has been trying to clean up its image — promising to verify all of its listings, for example, and taking a harder line on parties — as it prepares for an initial public offering of its stock. The IPO, which was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, could still take place later this year. Airbnb banned “open invite” parties at its rentals late last year after five people were shot and killed at an unauthorized party in Orinda, California. The company set up a rapid response team to deal with complaints from neighbors and started screening “high risk” bookings, such as reservations at a large home for one night. Airbnb went further last month, banning guests under 25 from booking entire homes close to where they live. In the most recent case, Airbnb said it will seek monetary damages and donate them to non-profit that fights gun violence in the Sacramento area.

The testing was originally scheduled for March but got delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Telecom operators will need six months of testing 5G devices and spectrum before we begin auctions,"" said a DoT official who did not want to be named. ""We are looking at providing the companies with the spectrum for the testing by September so that they can begin the process,"" the official said. Will Chinese companies be excluded from 5G Trials? CNBC-TV18 had earlier reported that a DoT committee had recommended banning Chinese telecom equipment companies from participating in the 5G trials and the subsequent auctions. The DoT official confirmed that Chinese companies will not be allowed to participate in the trials and auctions. This means that Indian telecom service providers cannot partner with Chinese telecom equipment makers.  The two Chinese players with a strong presence in the telecom equipment segment in India are Huawei and ZTE. ""From the companies that had submitted applications in December 2019, we are considering allowing only Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung to participate in the 5G trials;"" said the official. Bharti Airtel  had submitted its application to conduct trials in partnership with Samsung, Nokia, Huawei, and Ericsson. Vodafone Idea  had listed Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei as its partners. Jio mentioned Samsung as its partner but it also submitted an application to use its own 5G gear. ""Banning Huawei and ZTE from 5G will increase our procurement costs and reduce competitiveness in the 5G space.

The lockdown period in India has seen these players edging out their strategic peers and sealing several control or majority stake deals with quality targets available at attractive valuations. According to the IVCA-EY monthly roundup of private equity/ venture capital (PE/VC) investments, July 2020 recorded the highest value and number of buyout deals in the past 11 months. The total number of investments recorded in the month stood at $4.1 billion across 77 deals. However, this represents a 51 percent drop as compared to July 2019 which saw deals worth $8.4 billion, indicating that overall deal activity by PE funds and VC firms is still far below earlier peaks. Six deals with a combined value of $1.7 billion were struck during the month. The two largest deals were Thoma Bravo's buyout of the US subsidiary of Majesco Limited for $594 million and KKR's buyout of JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Limited for $496 million. The report notes that if PE investments in Jio Platforms in May and June, which were an outlier, were excluded, July 2020 has been the best month so far in 2020, recording investments worth $3.7 billion. The month recorded 10 large deals (value greater than $100 million). International PE funds investing from their global/ Asian funds accounted for 97 percent of the >$100 million large deals in H12020. M&A ACTIVITY : PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS VS STRATEGIC PLAYERS According to Vivek Soni, Partner and National Leader, Private Equity Services, EY, ""Globally, PE and VC industry is sitting on record levels of dry powder and as such these International GPs (general partners) do not lack capital, but rather are under pressure to deploy it on deals that make sense. As the Indian market matures, PE investors have increasingly embraced complexity and scale in deal making, borrowing from their globally successful buyout strategies."" So why are strategic players lagging behind in deal activity when compared to the PE funds? ""Most strategic players are facing challenges to their core businesses, like dip in demand, disruption in production / supply chain and pressures of highly geared balance sheets. As the overall business environment is challenging, strategic players in many sectors are finding it difficult to muster resources for inorganic growth plans,"" Soni explains. TECH, FINANCIAL SERVICES & PHARMA TOP THE PACK From a sectoral perspective, technology was at the top in July with $963 million invested across ten deals, followed by financial services with $882 million invested across 15 deals and pharmaceuticals with $699 million invested across three deals. Startups recorded $272 million in investments across 40 deals. registering a sharp year-on-year decline of 80 percent. THE ROAD AHEAD Exit activity continued to remain subdued, with $134 million in exits, primarily comprising of open market exits, the report said. There were no PE-backed IPOs and secondary exits in July 2020.

The improvement, even though small, will bring solace to the industry that continues to struggle because of the COVID-19 disruption. Year-on-year, however, the traffic declined 82.3 percent in July.  In July 2019, 1.19 crore passengers travelled by air. But here also there is a silver lining.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/coronavirus/how-do-pharma-companies-get-volunteers-for-covid-19-vaccine-trials-what-are-the-risks-and-other-questions-answered-5697001.html,"COVID-19 vaccine: How do pharma companies get volunteers for trials, what are the risks, and other questions answered","Two potential COVID-19 vaccines, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and  Zydus Cadila’s  ZyCov-D, are now being tested on humans in phase-1 and phase-2 clinical trials. Another vaccine maker, Serum Institute of India (SII), is expected to begin Phase 2/3 trials shortly. With the plethora of vaccine candidates being tested all around the world, there has been a lot of curiosity over how the trials are conducted and particularly about how volunteers are enrolled. The fact is, participating in such trials comes with risks and responsibilities. Let’s take a look at what is involved. What are the various phases of a drug or vaccine trial and how do they differ? In phase-1 and phase-2 of a trial, only healthy volunteers are recruited. Phase-3 accepts people with pre-existing medical conditions, including those with such conditions who are stable, those who are elderly, and children. Typically phase-3 begins following the submission of phase-1 and -2 data. How is a vaccine trial different from a drug trial? When it comes to testing a drug, healthy volunteers are recruited in phase-1 to check for safety, while patients are recruited in phase-2 and phase-3 to assess efficacy and safety. However, a vaccine, which is used to prevent a disease, is tested on a broad group of people.   How can people access information about clinical trials being conducted in India? Unlike, the US and Europe, where companies or sponsors of clinical trials run awareness campaigns and advertisements to enrol volunteers, in India clinical trials are generally low-profile affairs. The Clinical Trial Registry – India (CTRI) website is the principal source of information on various clinical trials, their recruitment status, the centres that are participating, and details of the Principal Investigators at those sites. You can find the clinical trial site (hospital) in your city or district, directly call or email the Principal Investigator, and express interest to volunteer for the trial. But searching information on the CTRI website is a little cumbersome. Some clinical trial sites, such as the Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, among the 12 sites where Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is being tested in Phase 1/2 trials, have made things convenient for potential volunteers by creating a dedicated  webpage . What does registration involve? The initial screening and registration of volunteers is done online by collecting details such as name, age, gender, body mass index, allergic reactions to drugs, vaccines and food, current symptoms (cough, fever, breathlessness etc), existing medical conditions such as pregnancy, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, asthma and so on. Those who meet the eligibility criteria are enrolled for the trial.   What happens once a volunteer is enrolled? Enrolment is just the first step. The enrolled volunteers will have to go through a medical examination, and are also tested for COVID-19 using an RT-PCR and antibody test. People who have tested positive for COVID-19, or those who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, are rejected from participation in the vaccine trial. Dr E. Venkat Rao, Principal Investigator for Covaxin at the Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, told Moneycontrol that the hospital has had to reject several volunteers, as they already have antibodies against COVID-19. This also points to the challenges in finding volunteers for trials should the disease spread widely. In its phase-2 trial, Covaxin is enrolling those aged 12-65, while ZyCov-D is enrolling subjects aged 12 and above (no upper limit has been specified). Covaxin will be tested on a sample size of 1,125 participants in Phase 1/2 and ZyCov-D on a sample size of 1,048. How long does it take to assess a volunteer and does consent have to be formalised? Rao says it takes about three days to complete the process of medical examination before recruiting eligible volunteers. The investigator, too, has discretion in accepting or rejecting a subject. The volunteer has to provide written and informed consent, after reading through the risks and responsibilities of participating in the trial.   What conditions do volunteers need to adhere to in order to participate in the trial and ensure it is conducted correctly? Volunteers will have to ensure they are available to fulfil the study’s requirements whenever needed. For instance, in the Covaxin phase-2 trial, volunteers will have to cooperate to get tested for an immunogenicity evaluation (measuring antibody levels) seven times over a period of 194 days. Males have to use condoms to ensure effective contraception with their female partner from the first vaccination until three months after the last vaccination. Females need to avoid becoming pregnant from the time of study enrolment until at least four weeks after the last vaccine dose. Also, volunteers should not participate in another clinical trial at any time during the study period and should allow storage and use of biological samples for future research. Are there any incentives for volunteers who participate in a trial? Volunteers will not be paid for participating in the trial. However, they are paid for food and travel to the clinical trial site. This will be fixed. The company that is sponsoring the trial will insure the volunteer against any unforeseen medical event or death related to the clinical trial. How are the trials carried out?

But Chatterjee said the private companies would also like to get more clarity on a few aspects related to the arrangement that has been proposed by the Railways. ""The nature and constitution of an independent regulator, designated speed of 160 km/hr, full cooperation in equitable use of track and signalling are some of the factors which would be playing on the minds of the private operators,"" he said. The Delhi-Mumbai route will be a sought after route for private train operations, feels Rajaji Meshram, Partner, EY India. ""The paying capacity of citizens in chosen origin-destination cities will be a key consideration for private train operators.

""That is the minimum that we are expecting,"" Narendran told analysts in a call on August 14. In the first quarter ending June 30, the company had said, its realisations were hurt because of the COVID-19 disruption. Overall, the steel major had reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore for the June quarter of FY21. It had reported a loss of 1,615.35 crore in the March quarter and a profit of Rs 714.03 crore in the June quarter of FY20. But things will start looking up from the second quarter, the company has hinted, as most of its clients start ramping up production. Tata Steel's capacity utilisation, which had slumped by over 50 percent post the lockdown in March, is back to 95 percent in July. The recovery has been led by clients in the auto sector, which consumes about 20 percent of the steel produced in India. ""The auto forecast has been improving week after week.  Earlier it was only the tractors, and now the two-wheeler segment, helped by demand from the rural markets, is doing well,"" Narendran said. The top Tata Steel executive said that while passenger vehicles are recovering fast, the same couldn't be said of medium and heavy commercial vehicles. The lighter commercial vehicles are faring better. The better demand scenario has already helped the company take a price hike of up to Rs 2,500 per ton, since June."" Though current prices are still below their pre-COVID-19 levels, it is unusual to see rates going up during the monsoon,"" Narendran said. Demand for steel usually falls during the monsoon, when construction activity - the biggest consumer of steel - comes to a standstill. But 2020, has been a different year on all counts. The improving domestic scenario will also see Tata Steel selling more in its home market, instead of exporting. While in the first quarter it had shipped half of its production to overseas markets, mainly in China and South-East Asia, exports will come down further in the second quarter. ""In the second quarter, we will export 25 percent of our production,"" said Narendran.

Dube, the former CEO of Jet Airways, had joined GoAir in February 2020. Initially, he was was serving as an advisor to the carrier. ""Vinay Dube has ceased to be in the employment of GoAir with immediate effect and hence ceases to be the CEO of the Company,"" the low cost airline said on August 14. The company added that its  Nominations & Remuneration Committee and the Board met on Friday, and appointed Khona as CEO with immediate effect. Khona was the CEO of GoAir for two years, from April 2009. He was also Vice President, corporate finance and strategist for the Wadia Group. This is what Khona says about his stint in Linkedin: ""After significant contribution to turn around Real estate and Textile divisions of Bombay Dyeing and after successfully handling other assignments for Britannia and Bombay Burmah, was bestowed the responsibility to turn around hugely loss making Domestic Aviation venture- Go Air- as the CEO at Go Air, spearheaded various initiatives to bring it to being the most profitable airline in India which gave huge confidence to the Promoters to then sign up 72 NEO A320 aircraft at the Paris Air Show in 2011."" Before returning to GoAir for the latest assignment, Khona was a partner at M/s. Talati & Talati LLP, in areas of business turnaround and restructuring. GoAir's statement on Friday acknowledges Khona's contribution, noting that he ""turnaround several businesses at Dunlop tyre group including at diverse geographies at Germany, UK and India. He also successfully carried out extensive corporate restructuring for a Shipping Venture and a financial and business restructuring for a German - India JV in renewable energy."" Signs of trouble The change at the top comes just a few days after  GoAir was put on cash-and-carry mode  by Airports Authority of India. A  BusinessLine report  had earlier this month said that AAI had asked GoAir to clear dues of Rs 60 crore. Latest domestic traffic numbers released by regulator DGCA show that GoAir had lost considerable market share. The market share of the Wadia family-owned airline dropped to 3.9 percent in the three months ending June, from 9.9 percent in March. The drop in market share, the most among all domestic airlines, showed that GoAir has been particularly hit bad by the disruption caused by COVID-19. Though the government had increased the capacity cap to 45 percent, airlines continue to struggle to fill seats. Being a privately held company, GoAir's financial condition is not known. But given that its listed peers IndiGo and SpiceJet have recorded huge losses, is also a sign of GoAirs precarious condition. While IndiGo  reported a loss of Rs 2,844 crore  in the first quarter, SpiceJet had  a  consolidated net loss of Rs 816.2 crore  for Q4 FY20.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/how-indian-private-train-experiment-stacks-up-against-australia-uk-5703061.html,"How Indian private train experiment stacks up against Australia, UK","The Indian Railways (IR) has initiated the process to award bids for first ever private train operation for 109 routes. In the draft concession agreement, the IR has revealed that the concession period is 35 years and each operator will procure as well as maintain rolling stock while infrastructure such as power supply for running trains, loco pilots, guards and tracks will be supplied by it for a fee. The concession agreement also lays down KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for punctuality, reliability of train services, safety aspects and upkeep of trains. The KPIs provide for stiff monetary penalties in case of breach of the outlined service standards. While the concession agreement will likely be tweaked further once feedback from prospective bidders comes in, a closer examination of the KPIs set by other countries shows that the Indian experiment has not spelled out the minute details seen in other countries on various parameters. At least not till now. There are some other significant points of difference between private train operations in other countries and the model being proposed for India. To begin with, the IR has been talking of setting up a sector regulator but from all available indications, bids for private trains would be awarded ahead of the regulatory body being constituted. So will the regulator regulate fares, for example, at a later date though the current provision says no fare regulation? In Australia and the UK, for example, the regulatory ambit is clearly defined. Second, the viability for operators in other countries depends heavily on non-fare revenue while projections for Indian operators show that the proportion of non-fare revenue in their total revenue in the first year may be just about 5 percent. This could mean a longer break-even period for operators. Indian KPIs According to the draft concession agreement which the IR has now shares, the operator will be liable to shell out a penalty in case a train is late. A penalty has also been prescribed if a train reaches earlier than the scheduled time and if the overall punctuality of services does not reach 95 percent in a year. A train would have lost punctuality if arrival at the destination station is delayed by more than 15 minutes. For every 1 percent reduction in the punctuality of a train, the operator will have to pay the government 'Indexed Haulage Charges' for 200 kilometres. The haulage charge has been fixed at Rs 512.31 per train kilometre and refers to the levy the concessionaire will be charged for using rail tracks and other infra of the IR. The government has also specified how much it will pay to the concessionaire in case the delay in operations can be solely attributed to it. Conditions where the concessionaire will have to pay no penalty for delays include bad weather, the train running over cattle or humans, law and order issues, public agitation, miscreant activity, accident and heavy traffic at level crossing gates. Besides punctuality and reliability of services, the IR has listed out general terms under the KPI section on upkeep of trains: clean and odour free toilets; no rats or pests on trains; clean food and potable drinking water etc without going into specifics. Australia According to the Draft Feasibility Report by RITES and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, the KPIs for an Australian operator specify that punctuality of trains should be 92 percent, reliability 98.5 percent and a high score on customer satisfaction surveys. It also specifies how many scratches are acceptable on train windows. And the limits on the number of offensive graffiti, the number of pieces of litter allowed per train and the size of such litter. So 98 percent of trains should be free of “offensive graffiti” and offensive scratching. And, 93 percent of trains should exhibit no more than three instances of graffiti per carriage. Train interiors should exhibit no more than three pieces of litter per carriage which are larger than the size of a credit card. And 95 percent of trains should be free of liquid spills greater than the volume of a cup of coffee! Detailed specs are also listed for many other parameters including passenger announcement systems and how many broken clocks, CCTVs or alarms inside cabins are acceptable. In all, there are 31 KPIs with micro details on parts etc with specifications on how many such breakdowns are acceptable. UK The UK has more than 20 such KPIs and performance benchmarks. The KPIs for a private train operator clearly state that no graffiti – offensive or otherwise – should be left on the train before passengers enter it each day and in case of scratches, the part of whole of the cabin should be removed from service within 48 hours. For the train operator in the UK, cancellations cannot exceed 2 percent of service while the specified target is less than a percent. Measured in minutes, the target for delays is under 5 minutes.

On the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), October gold contracts were trading lower by 0.6 percent at Rs 52,580 per 10 gram at 0915 hours. Silver was at Rs 70,259 per kg, down 1.1 percent. International spot gold prices, however, rose for a third straight session supported by a weaker US dollar. Spot gold was trading above $1,900 per ounce. However, bullion has fallen nearly 4 percent, so far, this week and was on track for its first weekly decline since early June, a Reuters report said. On MCX, gold settled above Rs 52,800 and silver above 70,600. Despite a decline in US unemployment claims, both the metals rebounded again. Data suggests that the Dollar index slipped below the 93-mark during the session before closing around 93.20. Indian CPI inflation rose to 6.93 percent and rupee ended lower. Experts are of the view that as long as gold holds above Rs 52,200, investors could use the dip to buy for a target of Rs 53,000 and higher. “Concerns raised over Russian coronavirus vaccine by the US, WHO and some other countries are supported safe-haven buying once again in both the precious metals,” Manoj Jain, Director (Head - Commodity & Currency Research) at Prithvi Finmart told Moneycontrol. “We expect both the precious metals to remain volatile in Friday's session but it will hold key support levels. Weakness in the dollar index, slower global growth concerns, and geopolitical tensions will continue to support prices.” On MCX, 52,220 will act as a major support on a closing basis, and if it sustains above 52,880, it could test 53,100-53,330 levels again. Silver has strong support at 69,200 on a closing basis, and if it sustains above 70,700, it could test 71,800-73,100 levels again. Trading Strategy Expert: Ravindra Rao, VP- Head Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Comex gold was trading moderately lower near $1,960/oz after gaining 1.1 percent the previous day. Weighing on the gold price is upbeat US economic data and higher bond yields. However, supporting price is a weaker dollar, ETF inflows, US-China tensions and rising virus cases. Expert: Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities International spot gold and silver surged higher on August 13 amid weak dollar and safe-haven appeal for the metals. Prices were supported amid concerns over a slow recovery in the US labour market that reinforced the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic. Technically, LBMA gold spot traded in the $1,912-$1,966 range, where it ended with more than 1 percent gains. Moreover, it is sustaining well above $1,920, which shows that bullish momentum will continue above this level. Resistance is at $1,951-$1,964 levels. Support is placed at $1,932-$1,920 levels. Domestic gold and silver rose on Thursday, tracking firm overseas prices and a weak rupee. Domestic bullion could remain range-bound and volatile on August 14.

Here are some options for Robinhood investors,"Are you a new investor who joined D-Street in 2020, and are planning to invest in the market for the long-term? If yes, the time is ripe to start your investing journey. Data suggests that more than 5 million demat accounts were added across brokerages in 2020, and most of the new-age investors, also known as, Robinhood investors are between 25-40 years. The good part is that many investors who have joined D-Street in 2020 are young and have age on their side, and additionally they don’t mind taking that extra risk. After hitting multi-year lows in March, benchmark indices have showcased strength rallying about 50 percent backed by ample liquidity and record retail participation. ‘Make hay while the sun shines’ might work for new-age investors as liquidity remains strong, but the real wealth creation would happen if they make a portfolio and diversify their risk to mitigate volatility. “The retail participation in the direct equity market saw a huge surge with an evident from new account opening with a brokerage firm along with a rise in trading volumes during the lockdown period. The trend is heartening to see as investors become more rational about investing as opposed to the situation which was seen in the previous crisis,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder, CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol. “A 25-year-old investor can allocate a higher percentage (30-40 percent) of their income as they will usually have less financial obligations. They should give more weightage to equities with an investment view of 15-20 years,” he said. Rohira further added that it is also imperative for investors at this age to limit their financial leverage by way of credit or borrowing to avoid debt burdens at later stages of life to attain financial independence. Expert: Paras Matalia, Head-StockBaskets, Samco Securities As a thumb rule, asset allocation can be looked at using the “100 minus your age” strategy wherein if you are 25, then you can invest 75 percent of your capital to equities and the remaining into debt. But it isn’t what we follow! We suggest bifurcating your capital into three parts: 3) Money that you do not need for the next year at least - invest in gold or other asset classes (3-5 percent of your portfolio). Expert: Harsh Jain, Co-founder and COO, Groww As you near your investment horizon, you will need to keep rebalancing your portfolio by increasing the debt amount and decreasing equity. So for instance, for the few first years, you may have 80 percent equity and 20 percent debt, which will ensure high growth of your investments. Towards the end, consider reversing the percentage; 20 percent equity and 80 percent debt. This will ensure your risk is minimised by the time you choose to redeem your funds after reaching the desired retirement corpus. Expert: Siddharth Panjwani, Chief Strategy Officer, Pickright Technologies This Independence day, a millennial aged 25 years can use this opportunity of having time on his/her side to have a deep think-through of his/her financial journey, choices, and financial destination. The next question is what should the goals be and how much is the amount needed for financial independence. This can vary very widely depending on lifestyle, but to put numbers to the issue at hand – let’s say that, currently a family of 4 including 2 kids in an Urban setting can survive at an annual expense of Rs 15 lakh, including Rent/ EMI, school fees, vacations, and entertainment. For someone who is 25 now, this expense would balloon to about 31 lakhs in 15 years assuming constant inflation of 5 percent. If the annual return from investment is say 12 percent, this annual expense would be taken care of by the return on an investment corpus of about Rs 2.6 crore. So, an investor aged 25 now has 15 years to be in a position for their returns on investment to take care of their annual expenses assuming they starts saving for that goal. This would mean a monthly (family) saving of about Rs. 51,500, assuming an annual return of 12 percent on investments. This is a very simplistic case with basic assumptions to and would need to be reviewed regularly as changes in life, career, geography occur, nonetheless it gives a sense of the economics involved.

Revenue from operations in the quarter gone by stood at Rs 2971.54 crore, a 63 percent fall compared to Rs 8030.27 crore registered in the year-ago period. Total expenses during the period were Rs 3040.51 crore, a decline of 57 percent over Rs 7,112.75 crore reported in the first quarter of the last financial year. Hero MotoCorp reported a 3.97 percent dip in sales to 5,14,509 units in July compared to the same month of the previous year. The company sold 5,35,810 vehicles in July 2019. Despite the prevailing economic slowdown, the company registered a sequential growth of 14 percent over June and reached more than 95 percent of wholesale dispatch numbers of the corresponding month in the previous year, the two-wheeler major said. ""The robust volumes have been driven by strong retail sales due to the positive market demand,"" it added. While there is cautious optimism on the demand trajectory, sales continue to be impacted by the micro-lockdowns in several parts of the country, Hero MotoCorp said.

The index remained lower for most of the session amid uncertainty over US stimulus measures and US-China tensions. But the good thing is that the volatility has been declining consistently, which generally gives support to the bulls and indicates that the downside, if it happens, will be limited. India VIX fell by 2.41 percent to 20.84 levels. ""Volatility has been falling for the last seven consecutive sessions and the gradual decline in VIX suggests that the bulls are using any decline as a buying opportunity, while the overall trend remains bullish,"" Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal said. Short-term traders should initiate long positions only on a strong close above 11,322 levels, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist–Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartviewindia.in said. Intraday traders can consider shorting below 11,240 and look for modest targets of 11,180 or so. The Nifty50 opened lower at 11,289 and traded in the range of 11,322 and 11,242.65 before closing 14 points lower at 11,308.40. The Nifty50 traded in a narrow range of 80 points. Trading bias seemed to have turned negative for the near term as the index failed to get past the previous session’s high but breached its low, Mohammad said. If the Nifty fails to get past 11,322 in the next session and slips below 11,242, then the downswing will get extended towards 11,140 levels. A breach of it on the closing basis will confirm short-term trend reversal bears’ favour, he said. Unless the bulls witness a strong close above 11,322, with wide intraday trading range, upward momentum will not gather pace and on such a close, strength can be expected to expand towards 11,450 levels, he said. Options data suggests that the Nifty may witness an immediate trading range of 11,000-11,500 for the next few days. Maximum Put open interest was at 11,000 followed by 10,500 strike, while maximum Call open interest was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 strike. Minor Call writing was seen at 11,400 and 11,300 strike while Put writing was seen at 10,400 then 10,500 strike. The Bank Nifty also opened lower and drifted towards 22,000 in the first hour but buying was seen at lower levels. It consolidated between 22,100 to 22,300 zone for the most part of the day and formed a small bullish candle on the daily scale. The index closed 36.80 points higher at 22,264. ""The index negated the formation of higher lows after four trading sessions but overall trend is positive with buy-on-dips strategy. Mechanical indicators are holding their bullish crossover and requires a follow-up buying to confirm the next momentum,"" said Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The crop harvested from February to April. Cooler temperatures with good water content in the soil improve the yield. Prices, too, play a critical role. Higher prices are generally announced to encourage sowing of the seed which is a kitchen staple. Lower prices can lead to farmers switching to other crops such as mustard, garlic and chana. In India, several varieties of coriander are grown. Badami, Eagle, Scooter, Single Parrot, Double Parrot and Special Ggreen are the most popular. Prices differ across varieties and determined by the quality and moisture content. The variant that is listed on the NCDEX is the Badami, which is light brown. India is among the top producers and exporters of coriander seed. Russia, Bulgaria and Italy are the other major growers of the seed. NCDEX coriander future price traded higher in July and August, so far, owing to easing of lockdown in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Increased buying is supporting spot and the future prices. But prices are currently sustaining at Rs 6,400-6,500 per quintal levels amid higher stocks from last year and reports of higher production for 2019-20. On August 11, NCDEX coriander future price closed at Rs 6,586 per quintal, 4.87 percent higher compared to Rs 6,280 on June 30. For the coming month, we are expecting coriander futures to witness uptrend as traders continue buying around Rs 65-66 per kg levels in the major mandis of Kota Ramganj (Rajasthan), Rajkot (Gujarat) and Guna and Neemuch (MadhyaPradesh). So far, buying by masala (spice) millers has been 80-85 percent of their total capacity and could increase in the coming weeks as traders are forecast lower stocks for the year 2019-20 ahead of the sowing season. Exports are still lagging behind amid rising coronavirus worries. India imports coriander seeds from Russia and Bulgaria in the June-August period as the seeds from these countries have a higher medicinal value. This could cap extreme bullishness in NCDEX coriander prices in the month ahead. We are bullish on NCDEX coriander September futures and prices are expected to move towards Rs 7,200 levels in the month ahead.

The management highlighted that recovery is encouraging across segments, and guided domestic revenues to be flat YoY in 2Q. However, export numbers expected to be slightly lower due to weakness persist in Oil & Gas segment. The company has accelerated the cost reduction measures (saving manpower & energy costs, consolidation of production facilities and digitization) which benefit was visible in Q1FY21; this will continue in next three quarters for FY21. Notwithstanding the adverse impact of the covid-19 disruption in the near term, we remain positive on BFL’s growth prospects on the back of improving outlook for class 8 trucks, recovery in demand of construction & mining equipment, focus on diversification (improving long term revenue prospects for PVs, Defence and Railways segments) and the cost optimization initiatives. BFL’s focus on balance sheet and re-structuring of cost across plants will help tide over the COVID-led disruption.

Q) RBI finally announced one-time loan restructuring after a lot of demand, but with riders. What are your thoughts and will it really solve the NPA problem for the banks? A) NPA is the biggest problem for the banking industry and post-COVID, this issue has become a bigger pain. Before COVID, the gross NPA of the banking industry was forecasted to reduce to 10 percent by September 2020 which has now increased to 12.5 percent in March 2021, as a baseline. The worst forecast is 14.8 percent if the rate of economic recovery subsides for a longer period, which will be a disaster for the banking system. Hence, restructuring of company loans which are directly impacted by COVID-19 is an essential part of the total plan which is very positive for the economy and banks. Q) After a rally from mid-May, do you think the market is due for a major correction which can drag the Nifty to 10,000 levels or do you see consolidation going ahead? A) We are not forecasting a major correction rather the possibility of a consolidation in the near-term due to low risk-reward ratio as a result of high valuation, negative earnings growth and weak fundamentals. The possibility of a deep correction is low due to high liquidity in the market and hope of a vaccine during the year. This outlook is venerable depending on the pace of vaccine development and implementation. Q) The broader markets still looked strong given the outperformance to benchmark indices (from March lows as well as year-to-date). Do you think midcaps and smallcaps can beat benchmarks this year, especially after underperformance in the previous two years? A) Yes, the possibility of mid & smallcaps to outperform the broad market is high. Because of cheap valuation compared to the largecaps and low risk of bankruptcy given supportive measures. In which we can expect a high quality of mid & smallcaps with solid credentials, clean balance sheet and leadership quality to hugely outperform the board market. Q) The IT index did not see a major impact of lockdown. In fact, work from home helped them a lot in terms of cost-saving. Even the index posted a strong rally YTD and from March lows. Have you increased your exposure to IT? A) Yes, the IT sector was amongst our best pick during the lockdown period due to stable outlook which we are continuing due to improvement in outlook with digitalisation. Out top picks are TCS where growth is expected to pick-up in the upcoming quarters with recovery in BFSI from Q2 FY21 onwards. Infosys, due to improved optimism in the company's long-term outlook and big deals. HCL Technologies, due to resilience in operation efficiency and solid services & product. In the short-term, concerns are that a good amount of gains is visible in IT largecaps trading at a premium valuation. But on a medium to long-term basis, we feel that this premium valuation and the possibility of further improvement in growth & valuation persists. Q) Given the sharp fall followed by a sharp rally within a span of just 6 months, what is your advice to investors/traders on this Independence Day? A) Yes, we are in a peculiar situation due to supremely high valuation increasing the risk of underperformance in the short-term. At the same time, business sentiment is building up inching the long-term outlook of the equity market. We suggest accumulation is the best strategy with a decent amount of exposure in mid & smallcaps. Some sectors like pharma, chemical and IT are likely to do well while value buying can be done in the Banking sector. Q) Pharma (with participation by every stock) remained the leading sector in the current rally. Would you still recommend taking exposure to this sector? A) Pharma was amongst our top pick during the lockdown period. And we expect this outperformance to continue in the short to long-term basis. COVID has helped the sector to regain its lost attention, in terms of its R&D, production and technology abilities to the world. Indian pharma sector was underperforming since 2015-16 and this change in trajectory could be a start to revamp its long-term outlook, in-terms of re-rate in investment, financial benefit and valuation. Q) An embargo was imposed by the government on the imports of 101 defence items under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat program. Are you a buyer in defence stocks given the sharp focus of the government on the 'Make in India' programme and what is your advice to investors?

Trump said Biden's proposed policies were not good for the country. ""Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicise a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people. That's what it is. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence,"" Trump told reporters on Thursday at the White House. ""The world will be laughing and taking full advantage of the United States if Joe Biden ever became President. Our Country would COLLAPSE!” Trump said in a tweet. Trump's tweet included a Fox News video clipping in which its news anchor was critical of Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal for praising Biden. The Fox News anchor described Jayapal as socialist and a genuine radical. ""Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans. You know that. He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early. If I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died. This is according to many people,"" the president said. Trump alleged Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every American community. “He wants to have ridiculous open borders. I've been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that if you have open borders, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, with open borders. So he wants open borders. The Democrats want open borders,” he said. While Biden will allow rioters, looters and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he also wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens, Trump alleged. “He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months. He thinks it's good politics. Different states are different, both in terms of the atmosphere and also in terms of the coronavirus problem,” he said. ""If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have,” Trump asked. The president alleged that Biden rejects the scientific approach in favour of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end. ""We've been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. But he wants them in the basement for months on end,"" he said. ""If we did what Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our healthcare system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including suicide, overdose, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms. It is very, very bad on the other side of the equation, when you do something like that. Those shutdowns are very punitive. Very punitive,” he said. Alleging that Biden's approach is regressive, Trump said that it is anti-scientific and it's very defeatist. “It would be very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines -- he has no clue -- we've been solving problems and delivering tremendous results. ""The most advanced and robust testing system on the planet; the number one producer of ventilators in the world by far; unprecedented industrial mobilisation -- biggest since World War Two, Operation Warp Speed to delivering lifesaving treatments and, very soon a vaccine,” he said.

Consolidated revenue fell ~47% YoY led by ~77% YoY fall in revenue of domestic business. However, overseas businesses were relatively less impacted and revenue fall was limited to only ~17% YoY during the pandemic. Profitability was largely impacted by a change in product mix, higher raw material prices (in Australia) due to disruption in supply and lower operating leverage.

The proposal aims to enhance the quantum of benefits to 50 percent of last drawn wages and extend the support period by three months. The Labour Ministry also proposes to do away with the condition that the benefit can be availed only once in a lifetime. If cleared, the move will benefit over 32 million ESIC subscribers if they ever find themselves unemployed. The proposal will be presented before the corporation meeting on August 20, The Economic Times  reported . The idea has the backing of the Prime Minister’s Office. ""The proposal has been presented to the PMO last week and will now be tabled in the corporation meeting scheduled next week,"" one of the officials told ET. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report. Track this LIVE blog for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic The plan is to double the insured amount to 50 percent of the last drawn salary and extend the tenure of benefit from three months to six months. The proposal also mentions reducing the minimum work requirement of two years to 78 days and allowing multiple withdrawals under the scheme subject to certain conditions. The ‘Atal Beema Vyakti Kalyan Yojana’ is a scheme that provides unemployment insurance to workers who have subscribed to the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) scheme. Under the Yojana, the government provides 25 percent of the monthly salary as unemployment benefit for three months.

Talking about the relevance of being self-reliant and swadeshi in the wake of COVID-19, he suggested that the pandemic has made it clear that globalisation did not yield desired results and one economic model cannot be applicable everywhere. Mutual cooperation among self-reliant countries while considering the world as one family and not one market seems to be the economic model required for the post-COVID world, Bhagwat said while speaking at a virtual book launch event. Track this LIVE blog for all the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic Backing the BJP-led NDA government's pitch for a self-reliant India, the RSS chief said swadeshi means to promote and give preference to indigenous products or technologies and not necessarily boycott all foreign items. He made it clear that only those materials or technologies should be imported which are not available locally or India lacks traditionally and these should be modified in an Indian manner. Citing a few examples when traditionally available products and technologies were overlooked for imported ones, Bhagwat emphasised on the need for change in mindset and not considering domestic items as inferior. Noting that even after independence, policymaking in India was influenced by the west and other foreign countries, Bhagwat said as a result many locally available products and technologies were overlooked in favour of foreign items. Describing the recently-announced National Education Policy as a ""step in the right direction"" to make India self-reliant, he said such policies will help India realise the potential of its people and of traditional wisdom.

Also, they will have to maintain at least 95 percent punctuality each year to avoid financial penalties,  reported  The Indian Express. The Railways had a second pre-application meeting with private firms on August 12 and shared a draft specification for running for private trains in India. The first pre-application meeting was held on July 21. According to the report, for every train that arrives at the destination at least 10 minutes in advance, the private company will pay the Railways incentive in the form of extra haulage charges for 10 km. The haulage charge is Rs 512.31 per km for a private train, which an operator must pay to Railways for use of its infrastructure and physical transportation of the train. In case of punctuality, for every percent of the reduction in the punctuality of a train from the guaranteed 95 percent, private operators will have to pay extra haulage charge worth 200 km of the train operation, said the report. However, if a train reports reduction in its punctuality by one percent in a year for reasons attributable to the Railways, the operating firm will get damages equal to 50 km of haulage charges by the national carrier, said the report. If trains are delayed due to reasons such as cattle or humans run over, agitations, bad weather etc, which are beyond the control of both the Railways and the private player, no one will pay anyone any amount, it said. In situations where train service is cancelled, the private player will still pay Railways haulage equal to one-fourth of the total amount payable for that journey, as per the report. Railways will also depute its “representatives” in the offices of the private companies to ascertain that they are reporting their earnings “honestly and faithfully”. In case, their actual revenue is found to be more than one percent of what is reported, the private firm will pay 10 times the difference thereof as damages to Railways, added the report. Twenty-three firms including Alstom Transport India Ltd, Bombardier Transportation India, Siemens Limited, GMR Infrastructure and some PSUs have shown interest in operating private trains in the country. These new trains will be in addition to the existing ones operated on the network. This is the first initiative of private investment for running passenger trains on the Railways network. The project would entail a private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore. ",india,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 11:03 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The draft EIA notification, which involves the procedure of issuing environmental clearances to various projects, was issued by the Environment Ministry in March and public suggestions were invited. The Environment Ministry had earlier said it would not extend the deadline for people to give suggestions and opinions beyond June 30 but later gave time till August 12. The draft EIA’s  critics claim  it rewards environmental offenders, puts “short-term profits of big business” over interests of future generations and limits public participation in environmental decision-making. Also read:  Opinion | Scrapping EIA 2020 not enough to save India In an article published in  The Hindu , Gandhi has urged the central government to withdraw the draft EIA 2020 notification. “What is essential is widespread public consultation to shape a national agenda that will place India at the forefront of the battle against global warming and pandemics,” Gandhi said. Terming the draft EIA as “disastrous”, Gandhi said the novel coronavirus pandemic “should have made the government reflect and reconsider its environmental and public health governance”. However, she said, the Environment Ministry “is handing out clearances during the lockdown without proper public consultations.” Gandhi said that among other provisions of the draft EIA, giving “a clean chit to polluters violating environmental regulations through ex-post-facto approvals will unleash unprecedented devastation on our environment.” Also read:  Rahul Gandhi says EIA draft must be withdrawn to stop 'loot of the nation' In the scathing piece, Gandhi said that it was “apparent that a Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government would be destructive to India’s environment going by Mr. Modi’s track record in Gujarat as Chief Minister.” “During the 2014 election campaign, Mr. Modi slandered the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and the Environment Ministry for being an impediment to the nation’s growth,” she added. But, she said, “From the very start, the government has desperately sought to project an image of ‘Ease of Doing Business’ to the world, mindless of consequences. It formed multiple committees, diluted laws and regulations across the board, and opened up vast tracts of forest land to a select few in the private sector.” ",india,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 11:43 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Sharad Pawar also said he has faith in the Mumbai Police, but added that he will not oppose if someone still wants the central agency's investigation into the case. Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. ""We attach absolutely no importance to what my grand- nephew says. He is immature...I have clearly said that I have 100 percent trust in the Maharashtra Police and Mumbai Police. But if someone still wants a CBI probe into it, then there is no reason to oppose that too,"" the NCP chief told reporters here after a meeting with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. He was asked about the demand for a CBI probe in the case being made some people, including by his grand-nephew Parth Pawar. Sharad Pawar said he does not want to respond to the allegations being levelled against the Maharashtra government in connection with the case. ""We feel sad if any person commits suicide. But I feel a bit surprised at the way it is being discussed (in the media),"" he added. The NCP patriarch further said he had recently been to Satara where a farmer expressed surprise to him on the discussion in the media over Rajputs death. The farmer said he felt surprised at the way it (Rajputs death) is being discussed in the media. ""He (the farmer) said 20 farmers committed suicide in Satara, but it was not even noted by media. So, I know what are the sentiments of the common people,"" Pawar added. Parth Pawar, who lost the last year's Lok Sabha election from Maval seat in Maharashtra, is the son of the NCP president's nephew and state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. On July 27, Parth Pawar met state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh demanding that the case of Rajput's death be handed over to the CBI or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) be formed with forensic experts to probe the case. Shiv Sena's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed ""pressure tactics"" were being used in the case of Rajput's death and the issue was being politicised as part of a conspiracy against Maharashtra. It is wrong to see the unfortunate suicide of the actor from a political angle, Raut said in his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana'. A tug of war has been going on between the governments of Bihar and Maharashtra over the Rajput death case. Maharashtra has been contending that Bihar had no jurisdiction in the matter since the death took place in Mumbai. Meanwhile, after the nearly hour-long interaction with Pawar at the Y B Chavan Centre here, Raut told PTI it was a routine meeting where many issues were discussed. He also posted a tweet, saying, ""Yes, I met Sharad Pawar and discussed developments in the state and the country. There is no need for anybody to worry or have stomachache."" Raut in his column 'Rokhthok' on Sunday also mentioned about his telephonic conversation with Pawar on some TV news anchors referring to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in first person.

The freight earnings, however, during the period managed to hold ground, according to the RTI reply provided by the Railways to Chandra Shekhar Gaur, a Madhya Pradesh-based activist. The first three months of this financial year, when the Railways had to suspend all its regular passenger services due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, the national transporter's revenue was in the negative -- Rs 531.12 crore in April, Rs 145.24 crore in May and Rs 390.6 in June (all in negative), the RTI reply said. ""The minus figures are being shown due to the fact that the value of refunds is more than the value of tickets booked,” said Railway spokesperson DJ Narain. An official explained that due to the suspension of services, tickets booked for travel in April, May and June were offered refunds, while fewer tickets were booked during these three months due to the restrictions. The Railways has cancelled all regular passenger services indefinitely. In the first quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, the Railways had earned Rs 4,345 crore in April, Rs 4,463 crore in May and Rs 4,589 crore in June. The Railways has said that due to the pandemic, it is envisaging a loss of around Rs 40,000 crore this financial year. “Passenger revenues of Railways are naturally expected to be low this year due to suspension of most of the services due to COVID-19 pandemic,” Narain said. However, freight traffic seems to have recovered somewhat since the Railways has been the preferred mode of transportation for ferrying essential during these months. In April 2020, the freight earning was Rs 5,744 crore, in May it was 7,289 crore and in June the number stood at Rs 8,706 crore. In the first quarter of last fiscal year, it earned Rs 9,331 crore in April, Rs 10,032 crore in May and Rs 9,702 crore in June. Narain said the Railways' freight operations during the last two weeks are higher than the last year's corresponding figures for the same period. “This is a very encouraging and positive sign for the things to come,” he said. A concerted effort by railway officials and better management practices will ensure that revenue lost in passenger segment is significantly offset by an outstanding freight performance, Narain said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/zomatos-latest-move-has-stirred-the-period-leave-debate-yet-again-5690691.html,Zomato's latest move has stirred the period leave debate yet again,"On August 8, food delivery startup Zomato introduced 'period leaves' for its women and transgender employees. The move, it said, was part of the company's effort to address the stigma attached to menstruation while also acknowledging the biological differences between men and women. The company said, ""all women (including transgender people) at Zomato can avail up to 10 days of period leaves in a year."" Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal said in a  note  to employees, ""There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma attached to applying for a period leave. You should feel free to tell people on internal groups, or emails that you are on your period leave for the day."" The move comes a year after the much-popular food delivery platform rolled out a 26-week paternity leave policy in June 2019. Stir on social media  However, the menstrual leave introduction by Zomato has yet again stirred up a controversy over whether the policy of period leaves at workplaces is a good or a bad idea. Differing opinions on the issue have polarised people on social media, giving rise to 'for' and 'against' camps. While some have said the concept of period leaves leads to the furthering of the notion that women are 'weak', others have pointed out that option of availing such leaves is a voluntary one and helps people with painful menstrual cycles. The naysayers also argue that such a policy will only prejudice employers against hiring women and lead to their alienation at work. Earlier this year, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's tweet  advocating  support for menstrual leave for women in public and private workplaces and calling for its support via a petition had also left Twitter divided, with many diverging opinions emerging on the topic. The severity of period-related pain and cramps (dysmenorrhea) experienced by menstruators varies. Several people suffer from medical conditions which only worsen the already debilitating period pain. The Endometriosis Society of India  estimates  that nearly 2.5 crore Indian women suffer from endometriosis, a chronic painful disorder that affects roughly 1 in 10 women globally. But is the idea an altogether new one? However, while the debate has going on for a very long time now, it would be interesting to note that the concept is not a new one in India. Several companies and workplaces have provided the option of such leaves to female employees. In fact, the Bihar government had introduced a similar option as early as in 1992, as pointed out by Kavita Krishnan, Secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association in a 2017  article . She said, ""...women employees in Bihar government services have been eligible for two days of leave in a month for this purpose, though not specifically stated, since 1992.""

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/forget-and-forgive-ashok-gehlot-tells-upset-mlas-loyalists-shift-to-jaipur-hotel-5691871.html,"Forget and forgive, Ashok Gehlot tells upset MLAs; loyalists shift to Jaipur hotel","Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday said resentment among the Congress MLAs is “natural” after the return of dissident legislators to the party-fold but asked them to forgive, forget and move on. But with just two days to go before the assembly session, the party is taking no chances, deciding to keep them together at a resort in the state capital. The MLAs in the Gehlot camp were on Wednesday flown back to Jaipur from Jaisalmer, where they were together at another hotel. They were taken straight from the airport to the Fairmont hotel on the outskirts of the city, where they had stayed before being moved to Jaisalmer. The MLAs – mostly from the Congress and some allies – are expected to remain there till the assembly meets on August 14. The Congress crisis in Rajasthan appears to have ended with the intervention of the top leadership of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who met rebel leader Sachin Pilot earlier this week Pilot had openly rebelled against Gehlot last month along with 18 other Congress MLAs. He was then sacked as deputy chief minister and the party's Rajasthan chief. Meeting reporters in Jaisalmer, Gehlot said he had urged the MLAs to bear with the develoipement, while acknowledging that it was “natural” for them to be upset. “Forget and forgive and move on in the interest of the country, the state, the people of the state and democracy. Democracy in under threat. This was a fight to save democracy, in which our MLAS gave their support,” he said. At earlier Congress Legislature Party meetings, the loyalist MLAs had called for disciplinary action against the dissidents who defied party whips while demanding a change in the leadership in the state. Gehlot had himself called the now sacked PCC president “useless”, using the derogatory Hindi word “nikamma” for Sachin Pilot. ""It is natural for them to be upset. The way this episode happened, they had to stay in hotels,” he said Wednesday, in an apparent reference to the previous evening's Congress Legislature Party meeting in Jaisalmer. “I have exhorted them that in the interest of the country, state, people of the state and for saving democracy, sometimes we have to bear this,” he said. He said that more than 100 MLAs stayed together for such a long time, which is a big thing in itself and had never happened in the history of the country. The chief minister said all MLAs, including those who have “returned” now, will work together to fulfil the commitments made to the people of the state. In Jaipur, as the loyalist MLAs headed to the Fairmont hotel, Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas confirmed that they are not happy with the turn of events. “Yes, several MLAs said they are upset and saying this is their right,” he said, while reminding that a decision has already been taken by the party high command. AICC general secretary Avinash Pande, who too came to Jaipur from Jaisalmer, said the MLAs remained united. The Gehlot government will complete its five-year term, he said. “We will also win the next assembly elections in 2023.” Independent MLA Sanyam Lodha said the dissident MLAs have returned unconditionally. Congress deputy chief whip Mahendra Chaudhary called the events a victory of the Congress and the BJP's defeat. The party had alleged that the BJP was trying to topple the Gehlot government by trying to lure away Congress MLAs. The MLAs in the Ashok Gehlot camp had moved into the Fairmont hotel in Jaipur on July 13 and were shifted to Jaisalmer's Suryagarh hotel on August 31.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/pricing-in-hospitals-amidst-covid-19-general-insurance-council-to-take-legal-route-5702791.html,Pricing in hospitals amidst COVID-19: General Insurance Council to take legal route,"The General Insurance (GI) Council is planning to file an appeal to implead in a matter regarding an ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court on charges incurred in hospitals for Coronavirus (COVID-19) treatment. The GI Council wants to point out that insurers cannot compensate by paying high costs for infection-control measures in hospitals. In July, a PIL was filed by lawyer Sachin Jain against exorbitant charges in the private hospitals for COVID-19 costs. During the hearing, senior advocate Harish Salve representing Healthcare Foundation of India had said that health insurance customers who can afford the costs should not mind as the insurers will foot these bills. Salve had also said that hospitals are not making money and that there is a tremendous financial burden due to COVID-19 treatment and decrease in footfalls of non-Coronavirus patients. GI Council is the industry body of the non-life insurance and standalone health insurance companies in India. This body will be making an appeal to implead with the industry consensus. “There is a perception that insurers have deep pockets and keep paying out high claims. However, that is not the case. If insured customers keep overcompensating for uninsured persons in hospitals, the premiums will go up,” said an official. Insurance works on a pool concept. So whatever money is collected as a premium is paid out as claim. If in a year the claim paid out exceeds the premium collected, the excess amount is passed on to customers in the next year in the form of a premium hike. ""Already there is an under-penetration of insurance. If premiums keep going up then insurance will become unaffordable. We want to bring this to the notice of the apex court,” the official from GI Council added. GI Council is engaging lawyers and will file an appeal to implead in the PIL and offer their viewpoint on the perception that general insurers are able to pay high claims. This appeal will be filed by August 18. Till now, close to 100,000 claims related to COVID-19 have been filed with general insurance and health insurance companies. These claims amount close to Rs 1,500 crore. However, less than half of this amount has been settled so far by general/health insurers. A standard package was devised by the GI Council so that there is a reference rate for insurers when COVID-19 claims are filed. However, insurance company executives told Moneycontrol that charges are not being equally divided. “For masks, gloves and PPE kits, only the insured persons are being charged and not others. How is this fair? Why should only insurers keep paying for others just because a person has bought a health insurance,” said the claims head of a mid-sized private insurer.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/74th-independence-day-is-room-for-reasoned-debate-shrinking-5703301.html,74th Independence Day | Is room for reasoned debate shrinking?,"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear: George Orwell As another Independence Day nears, the shrinking space for freedom of expression in India is a cause for great concern. Over the years the leeway even for reasoned debate has been eroded to such an extent that today one can debate on sensitive topics only by putting oneself at physical risk. Just about anything can be deemed “sensitive”. When Article 19 (1) of our Constitution was being drafted by the founding fathers of our nation, they did say that all citizens will have the right to freedom of speech and expression, but then they made it clear that such freedom was not absolute, and was subject to restrictions by the State. The problem arose when they outlined these restrictions without defining them in detail, which meant that the State could find virtually anything objectionable. For example, violation of decency and morality was one basis on which freedom of speech and expression could be restricted. However, what was indecent and immoral was left to be decided on a discretionary basis. So too for several other restrictions. This has led to States interpreting the law in the manner they deemed fit, leading to a virtual assault on the freedom of speech and expression. The explosion of social media has led to several situations where inflammatory and objectionable material, which would have never found its way to print, is freely circulated to audiences of hundreds of thousands. The State is certainly justified in taking action when such material is prejudicial to maintenance of law and order, but often such posts have not elicited action. Instead, government after government has been cracking down and arresting those who put up social media posts abusing chief ministers or other government or political functionaries. In the last two years we have seen such arrests in most states, but notably Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala, Tripura, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Why the Chief Ministers can't sue these people for defamation is beyond comprehension. After all, these are personal posts against an individual who happens to occupy a public office. They may be slanderous, libellous or defamatory, but how are they a threat to the State? Yet such posts are often met with arrests. During the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime, a man in Puducherry who posted ‘objectionable’ material against Karti Chidambaram, son of former Finance and Home Minister P Chidambaram, was arrested despite the fact that at the time of the incident Karti Chidambaram was not holding any public office. Thus, the message is clear. You write critical posts about those in power at your own peril. Everyone from the social media user to the journalist and cartoonist is at risk. India's rank in the World Press Freedom Index has fallen to a sorry 142 out of 180 countries. RSF, the organisation that publishes this ranking, says in its latest report that the “pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government’s line has increased. The co-ordinated hate campaigns waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are alarming. Criminal prosecutions are meanwhile often used to gag journalists critical of the authorities, with some prosecutors invoking Section 124a of the penal code, under which “sedition” is punishable by life imprisonment.” Even cinema, a traditional medium of expressing angst against the system is lying low for fear of not knowing who would get offended by what and the consequences of such actions. To be fair this is an issue where almost every political party must share the blame. Whether it is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Congress, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) or the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or the Trinamool Congress Party (TMC), every party has stifled uncomfortable voices leading to the erosion of a valuable freedom guaranteed by the Constitution. The Emergency may be an oft quoted example, but over the years there has been a gradual and creeping assault on the freedom of speech and expression. In many ways this has been far more dangerous. The U-turn taken before the Supreme Court by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on Section 66A of the IT Act shows how all parties wish to retain the power to throttle discordant voices and control public perception. One difference between the earlier days and the present is that those who carry out the assaults on freedom now hunt in packs. Backed by armies of online trolls and paid agents, the creation of a dangerous narrative is a lot quicker. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 04:08 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/independence-day-what-freedom-means-for-a-young-india-5703421.html,Independence Day | What freedom means for a young India,"India has changed dramatically in the last 30 years, and with it has evolved the idea of what it means to be free in this country. With limited opportunities and a closed economy, our measure of independence remained circumspect at best in the 1980s and before that. Then came liberalisation, and things turned on their head. The economy opened, and the careful, pragmatic, practical ways of being were replaced by a heady sense of possibility and optimism. Liberalisation not only opened up the economy, but also gave an entire generation a new set of economic and social freedoms. A refrain commonly heard against young people is how they tend to take these freedoms for granted, since they didn’t have to fight for it. This is at best the cynic’s view. Sure, unlike the previous generations, this generation doesn’t have the memories of the Indian independence movement in their DNA, but that doesn’t make it any less patriotic. In fact, if anything, being completely unshackled by the colonial mindset makes the younger generation all the more unencumbered. From the JP movement in 1974 to the recent protests happening in universities across the country, India’s youth still continues to be at the forefront of all social change. So, what does freedom mean to this new generation? Constituting  34.8 percent  of the population, it would probably be naive to ascribe a single meaning to the aspirations of 421 million people. It would also be simplistic, since young people in India are not a monolithic group. They fall under two broad groups. The first is an urban, affluent minority that has access to education, social mobility/capital and the benefits the standing accords. Propped up on the ladder of privilege, for this section, freedom translates to rising further up the ranks: finding fulfilling jobs, chasing entrepreneurial dreams, earning social capital, and generally having the independence to pursue their goals and passions without impediment and social pressures. Then, there are the hundreds of millions of youth that constitute the rural, poor majority living in small towns and villages — excluded not just from an increasingly digital society, but also from access to institutions and social rights. To this second group, freedom translates as the necessity to climb out of a life of deprivation and poverty, of social and economic discrimination to a better, more stable place. So, while there exists a huge disconnect between the lived realities of these two groups, there is also something that connects them: aspiration. This is a generation of dreamers, hungry for success and desperate to achieve it at any cost. While this young generation supports many liberal values, one value above all else matters most to it — economic independence, and the promise it holds to build a life of one’s choice. Sadly, the road to getting there is far from easy. India’s youth may be hungry for change, economic independence, and the freedoms that come with it, but the majority of them fall in one of the three categories: uneducated, unemployed, or unemployable. This is also what constitutes the contradiction of sorts. Liberalisation exposed this generation to the dreams of a better future, but India’s growth story hasn’t been able to keep up with their aspirations. In that sense, this is a generation of Indians hanging between extremes — desperate to succeed at all costs, but having limited support systems to seek help from. Presently, they also seem to have dim chances at making it big —  one million Indians  enter the job market every month while perhaps a small minority find steady jobs — but carry the burden of the grandest notions about success and societal pressures to achieve that. They are also increasingly getting convinced that if they want to succeed, they can neither rely on governments or corporations. Technology, which has grown and matured with this young India, has proved to be a game changer to some extent flattening the inequities. However, considering things like reach and affordability, technology alone isn’t nearly enough to power their aspirations. Not that it is likely to stop this generation from aiming big. No matter how poorly placed they find themselves, this generation is irrational in its thirst for a better life, and it sees absolutely no reason why it should settle for less. Unhinged by practicalities and expectations, in that sense, this generation maybe truly free. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 02:40 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

In comparison, the industry had added 5 lakh new folios in June. According to data from Association of Mutual Funds in India, the number of folios with 45 fund houses rose to 9,21,05,737 at the end of last month, from 9,15,42,092 at June-end, registering a gain of 5.63 lakh folios. Of the total new folios last month, more than 4 lakh were added in debt funds. Market experts say that the addition of folios suggests that investors were undeterred by the market volatility. Besides, it indicates their understanding of the market risks associated in the mutual fund schemes. The sector added 6.13 lakh investor accounts in May, 6.82 lakh in April and 9.1 lakh in March. ""The sharp fall in the markets in the month of March provided a good premise for investors to invest in the equity markets. Hence, it's quite likely that many new investors would have found this as an opportune time to invest in the equity markets through mutual funds route,""  said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director Manager Research at Morningstar India. ""This is evident form the sharp surge in the number of folios in the month of April. There was an uptrend in the number of folios in the month of May and June too highlighting investor interest,"" he added. Folios are numbers designated to individual investor accounts. An investor can have multiple folios. The number of folios under the equity and equity-linked saving schemes marginally dropped in July. The investor count slipped by 368 to 6.37 crore. The debt oriented schemes folios count went up by 4.25 lakh to 68.85 lakh. Barring overnight funds, all the categories in debt funds witnessed a growth in folios. Corporate bond funds added 60,269 folios in July, followed by liquid funds (58,379), short duration funds (54,002) and banking and PSU Funds (51,626).

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/entertainment/heres-whats-helping-tiktok-helo-employees-land-jobs-at-short-video-sharing-apps-5700311.html,"Here’s what’s helping TikTok, Helo employees land jobs at short-video sharing apps","Competition in the video-sharing space has heated up after TikTok and Helo were banned in India. Companies vying for supremacy in this segment are now keen to hire talent from the two ByteDance-owned  companies, who helped the two Chinese platforms grow rapidly in India. TikTok alone had racked up a user base of 200 million in India by the time it was banned. California-headquartered Rizzle, a 60-second video app, and Bolo Indya have confirmed that they are looking to hire  employees from TikTok and Helo. While Rizzle is looking to hire seven employees, Bolo Indya is planning to hire 15. Varun Saxena, Founder, Bolo Indya, shared some details on the company’s plans. “We are looking to hire at different levels. For content operation, we are looking to hire eight to 10 people and when it comes to mid-level and senior level, we are looking to hire three to five people.” Lakshminath Dondeti, Co-Founder, Rizzle, said the company was “attracting a number of sharp engineers, marketers, and other talented individuals from ByteDance. And in the past three months, we have expanded our team by 30 percent and will continue to hire new talent.” As for the cost of hiring talent from TikTok and Helo, Saxena said the salaries of ByteDance employees were at par with the general standard in Indian companies. What is the ByteDance talent bringing to the table? “The handy experience and the already established network that they (ByteDance employees) bring to the table is probably something a fresh hire or someone who was not working with these two platforms (TikTok and Helo) would have to develop from scratch. You get a time advantage,” explained Saxena. “If someone has worked for entertainment as a category at TikTok or Helo, they know influencers already, they know a lot of local-level celebrity content creators already, they understand how they work, the kind of deliverables… and this helps us quickly rather than taking the longer route, where we do our own research.” Love for language For Bolo Indya, language is a key criterion and this is why it is hiring ByteDance employees. The knowledge-sharing short-video platform lets users create two-minute videos in 11 Indian languages. “We are looking at the understanding of a language — for example, an employee from Helo or TikTok working in the Gujarati language. This person understands what content and at what point of time content goes viral in Gujarati. So, it is about pushing the right set of content for a language-specific set at the right time. We are also looking at the network an employee can bring on board for a language,” said Saxena. For Bolo Indya, much of the traction is from tier-II and -III markets. And the loyalty for language content is much more in Tamil, Telugu and Bengali. Thirty-five percent of the user base on the platform is from Hindi speaking markets, and another 30 percent from the Tamil, Telugu and Bengali markets. TikTok, Helo caught the local pulse TikTok and Helo lay a lot of emphasis on language, which significantly helped their expansion in India. TikTok’s team spoke in 14 Indian languages. “I think, it is fundamentally important that the team is based in the country and speaks local languages to make culturally relevant decisions, ByteDance Director (International Public Policy) Helena Lersch had said last year in April in an interview with PTI. Experts also pointed out that TikTok’s team was smart enough to foresee what they had to advertise in domestic markets from the content and cultural point of view. When it comes to its language focus, TikTok had also announced safety centres in 10 Indian regional languages last year. As for Helo, the platform, which was available in 14 Indian languages, had taken regional social media by storm. It had, among other things, partnered with the Tamil and Marathi version of reality show Bigg Boss and users were able to meet their favourite participants from the show on the platform. The app also became a favourite of celebrities to connect with local fans in regional languages. A good time to hire The time seems right to hire employees as video-sharing platforms are witnessing strong traction after the ban on TikTok. More than the lockdown it was the anti-China sentiment that led to significant growth for Bolo Indya. Before the lockdown, the platform saw 5,000 to 7,000 new users signing on every day. During lockdown or mid-April onwards, the number went up to around 10,000 to 15,000. But within 10 days of anti-China sentiment increasing from the end of April, Bolo Indya saw over 1,25,000 users coming on to the platform. Almost 90 percent of the users who joined the platform within these 10 days had switched from TikTok to Bolo Indya. The common sentiment was that they wanted to try an Indian app. ",business,"Last Updated : Aug 14, 2020 03:13 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The Nifty midcap index was up 1.57 percent and smallcap gained 0.75 percent. The Nifty closed below its opening levels and hence formed a bearish candle that resembled the Doji indecisive formation. A Doji candle indicates there is some indecisiveness among the bulls and the bears and bounce were being sold in the absence of follow-up buying interest. Given the rangebound trade for around a week, the market could be waiting for firm directions on either side, hence traders should be cautious, experts say. As the Nifty seems to be in a no-trade zone, traders should wait for a breakout in either direction, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. The bulls seem to be in a strong position and major correction is unlikely, as volatility has been falling, experts say. India VIX fell by 1.31 percent at 20.56 levels. The Nifty50 opened higher at 11,334.85 and hit an intraday high of 11,359.30 but wiped out the gains in late morning deals to hit the day's low of 11,269.95 in afternoon. The index settled at 11,300.50, down eight points. The Nifty50 continued to be listless as the trading range remained 90 points. “Albeit technical picture on oscillator front continues to remain mixed, fresh sell signals on lower time frame charts are being witnessed,"" Mohammad said. The weakness in the price chart and slowing momentum on the RSI chart, which was developing a negative divergence with a lower top, was favouring the bears, he said. Contraction of the Bollinger Bands on the daily chart was also hinting a breakout in the Nifty, which should pave the way for swift move in either direction, he said. ""While weakness will be confirmed on a close below 11,242 levels, strength shall resume on a strong close, with wide intraday trading range above 11,322 levels. On such strength, a higher target towards 11,450 can be expected. A breakdown below 11,242 can set the tone for a swift downswing, with eventual target placed around 10,882 levels,"" he added. Options data indicated that the lower end of the trading range shifted higher. The Nifty could witness an immediate trading range of 11,100-11,500 against 11,000-11,500 in the previous session. Maximum Put open interest was seen at 11,000 followed by 10,500 strike, while maximum Call open interest was at 11,500 followed by 12,000 strike. Minor Call writing was witnessed at 11,500 strike followed by 11,700 strike while Put writing was seen at 10,600 then 11,000 strike. The Bank Nifty opened higher at 22,395.20 and hit a day's high of 22,439.95 but failed to hold above 22,400 zone and drifted lower to 22,139.60. It remained consolidated for most part of the session with selling pressure at bounce. The index fell 67.70 points to close at 22,196.30 and formed a bearish candle similar to a Dark Cloud Cover on the daily scale. ""Mechanical indicators are still holding their bullish crossover but require follow-up buying to confirm the next momentum, else this bounce could take a pause for consolidative move,"" Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol. The index will have to stay above 22,000 zone to move towards 22,500 then 22,750. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 21,750 then 21,500, he added.

The yellow metal prices have witnessed sharp volatility in the last few days as market participants evaluate further direction after a sharp fall from recent highs. The talks between the Democrats and the White House continue regarding the new coronavirus relief bill keeping the markets' hope high. US CPI was reported better than expectations in July, the inflation number increased by the most in 29-1/2 years amid broad gains in the costs of goods and services. The rate of 10 gram 22-carat gold in Mumbai was Rs 48,274 plus 3 percent GST, while 24-carat 10 gram was Rs 52,701 plus GST. The 18-carat gold quoted at Rs 39,526 plus GST in the retail market. “The main reason that we expect the gold price to go higher relates to the theories that dominate thinking within the halls of policy-making -- chiefly the theory that the economy can be made stronger via more monetary inflation, more credit expansion and more government spending,” said Chirag Mehta, Sr. Fund Manager- Alternative Investments- Quantum AMC. While we are witnessing a correction and sideways consolidation in the short term, gold holds strong potential over the long term as fundamentals are stronger than ever. “The main reason to own gold is the sheer fact that it is an extremely good portfolio diversification tool. It thereby helps you to reduce overall portfolio risk. These corrective phases are just the opportune time to build your gold allocations,” said Mehta. Navneet Damani, Vice President, Motilal Oswal said, “Gold and silver witnessed wild swings after a steep fall from record highs in an earlier session, but managed to close above the key levels. US 10-year yields dipped from one-month highs, reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing gold.

The company had reported a profit of Rs 451.8 crore in the corresponding period of the last fiscal. Consolidated revenue declined significantly by 65.6 percent YoY to Rs 818.2 crore in the quarter. Hit by lockdown, volumes fell sharply though the company saw good demand recovery towards the end of the quarter. ""The previous quarter put forth unprecedented challenges for the industry and for Eicher Motors. However, we believe that the long term potential for both Royal Enfield and VECV is very promising. Towards the end of the quarter, we have witnessed encouraging consumer sentiment which was evident in our sales for the month of June. We believe that this trend will continue into this (Q2FY21 ) quarter as well,"" Managing Director Siddhartha Lal said. International business at Royal Enfield is doing extremely well, led by the modern 650 Twin motorcycles and the Himalayan, he added. Commercial vehicle company VECV signed a definitive agreement with Volvo Group India Pvt Ltd for acquisition of its bus business under Volvo Buses India. Lal believes the integration will be instrumental in shaping the future of the Indian bus industry. Royal Enfield sold 58,383 motorcycles in the June quarter, a decline of 68 percent from 1,81,966 units sold over the same period in FY 2019-20. VECV registered an 84 percent decline in sales with 2,129 units as against 13,331 units in the Q1 of last year. The segment reported a loss of Rs 120 crore for June quarter against a profit of Rs 38 crore last year. ""The last quarter has been challenging for the commercial vehicle industry with almost complete washout in the first two months of the quarter on account of the pandemic. Since the economic activity was impacted, the movement of goods and services was also severely impacted. As a result, the industry has witnessed one of the worst quarters with an overall volume decline of 91 percent,"" Vinod Aggarwal, MD and CEO VECV said.

The COVID-19-led lockdown hit demand, which resulted in falling gross refining margin (GRM). The state-run oil refining company had posted a loss of Rs 1,361 crore in the March quarter and profit of Rs 1,075 crore in June quarter of 2019. Revenue from operations plunged 43.8 percent sequentially and 49.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 38,785.1 crore in Q1 FY21.

The S&P 500 during the session broke above its record high closing level of 3,386.15 from Feb. 19, just before investors sold shares in anticipation of what proved to be the biggest slump in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Its intraday record high of 3,393.52 was also set on Feb. 19. A slump in Cisco Systems weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 after the company forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below estimates. Concern about corporate outlooks has continued despite a mostly stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings season. ""The outlook for earnings in the next few quarters seems to be getting watered down by a lot of big companies,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It's making for a sluggish market without a real catalyst to push it up and over the hurdle for good,"" he said. Apple Inc rose, helping to support the Nasdaq and limiting losses in the S&P 500. Also limiting bearishness, jobless claims fell below 1 million for the first time since efforts to curb the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States began five months ago. Wall Street has recovered most of the trillions in market capitalization lost during the start of the pandemic and the Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to hit a record high in June. The Dow remains below its February peak. Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 80.12 points, or 0.29%, to 27,896.72, the S&P 500 lost 6.9 points, or 0.20%, to 3,373.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.27 points, or 0.27%, to 11,041.51. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased to 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8, the lowest level since mid-March. But the expiration of a $600 weekly jobless supplement at the end of July likely contributed to the decline. Data last week showed the economy has regained only 9.3 million jobs of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April, indicating a long road to reach pre-pandemic levels.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/do-not-be-penny-wise-pound-foolish-how-investors-can-ensure-financial-independence-5696531.html,"Do not be penny wise, pound foolish! How investors can ensure financial independence","Financial independence refers to a state where one has enough resources at disposal to meet expenses as well as fulfill future financial goals. The first step to be taken on this journey is to stop procrastination. Different individuals will have different investment strategies as the goals (marriage, health, education, etc.) would vary, as would the time horizons and risk preferences. One should research the fundamentals of an investment, cutting out unnecessary white noise, do own due diligence to make informed decisions, and never follow a herd approach. One should also prepare for the base, best and worst-case scenarios along the investment horizon and adhere to it. This curbs emotional investing, irrational impulsive behavior, and any knee-jerk reactions. One should not be swayed by exuberance, fear, or any aberrations. Volatility over the long run should not erode a substantial portion of the corpus. Slashing expenses can be a good passive way to start paving the path to a well-thought-out portfolio – do not be penny-wise, pound-foolish. This is in a way, equivalent to deciding whether an investment is over-valued and if yes, then decide to cut positions in it. As in the case of making an investment, cutting expenses also involves an understanding of the pros and cons at the nuts-and-bolts level. One form of expense reduction could be debt trimming. One should nip existing debt in the bud, and try to avoid taking on more “bad debt” in the future. Examples of bad debt range from high-interest credit cards, to personal loans used for extravagant discretionary purchases. One should always target reducing the most costly debt first as then interest expense would go down, thus freeing up more money. Not all debt is bad however and once again a sound cost-benefit analysis for taking on loans needs to be made. For instance, taking on a home loan implies one could be a homeowner and the concerned property might appreciate in value significantly over the long run depending on the right market conditions and investment. Starting early in this journey always has an advantage. One should make sufficient savings and investments in the early stages of one’s career. The regular source of income could be used to build a corpus of funds that should take care of all our expenses and needs. Next, one needs to lay down one’s goals and its interpretations on one’s financial balance sheet. This sets us the target that our portfolio needs to reach over the long run, decided by the time-line of our milestone goals. Depending on the combination of the worth of the future corpus needed to fulfill our goals and the time span required for the money to mature into that worth, one can then decide on the split-up of the investment pie. For instance, if our goals are ambitious and/or the investment time horizon is short, one would have to add in potentially riskier investments, possibly like equity to achieve the targets. As mentioned, risk of the portfolio increases leading to higher swings in volatility, and one may not be able to stomach such roller-coaster rides, thus leading to impulsive selling at lows or other emotional decisions. Consequently, one should then step back, ponder and possibly reduce some of the ambitious elements of our goals: either the needs or the time horizon for reaching them. One should never forget to keep a buffer of liquidity always at disposal to capitalize on any opportunity along the way or for any emergency situation so that the core corpus is never touched. Any cash inflows can now be invested into this strategic asset allocation and rigorously stuck to. However, along the way, there would come opportunities where one could capitalize on mentioned instances by deviating away from strategic asset allocation. This technique is called tactical asset allocation where one tactically strays away from strategic asset allocation to capture potential upside in the short term if attractive enough. Once such an opportunity plays out, one should then again maintain discipline in rebalancing the corpus back to the strategic asset allocation. Should an investment decision turn out to be wrong, one should not hesitate in biting the bullet and pulling the trigger? It is better safe than sorry i.e. better to sit in cash in the worst case, rather than worry about the opportunity cost of not remaining invested in such a dubious asset. The portfolio and its performance need to be reviewed periodically and that in turn, would depend on the investment horizon of each of the originally thought-out goals. One should not be ultra-microscopic and review performance every minute unless of course one is a day-trader. Bottom-line is that the review frequency should be in sync with the concerned investment horizon. The volatility of the portfolio should be seen in intervals matching the review frequency ideally and commensurate return ratios and metrics should be analyzed as well. Changes to strategic and tactical asset allocation would no doubt have to be made on the basis of this review and such apt decisions should help one reach towards the ultimate goal of financial independence.

For long, people who invested in gold were considered orthodox investors with low risk-appetite and the ones who always expected the worse. They used gold as a hedge against any financial calamity. As the coronavirus batters economies across the globe, gold has stood firm, barring occasional volatility, to emerge as the best performing traditional asset in the world. After Russia approved a vaccine for COVID-19, gold saw panic selling as investors assessed the prospects of other asset classes. The yellow metal slipped from an all-time high of Rs 56,000 to below Rs 50,000 per 10gm. But things don't change overnight, and for equities, it takes even longer. Volatility may continue Given its sharp rally in the last few months, a correction was due in gold prices, say. On the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), October gold contracts were trading lower by 0.07 percent at Rs 52,218 per 10 gram at 0915 hours. The metal may continue to see volatility but buying on dips is a smart strategy, analysts say, “Higher than expected US CPI and Core CPI data, weakness in the dollar index and varied voices on Russian coronavirus vaccine supported precious metals at lower levels. We expect both the precious metals to remain volatile in Thursday’s session,” Manoj Jain, Director (Head - Commodity & Currency Research) at Prithvi Finmart told Moneycontrol. “We suggest buy-on-dip in both the precious metals as weakness in the dollar index continues to support precious metals at lower levels,” Jain said. Remain invested in gold Concerns over a widening US-China rift, a sharp increase in coronavirus infections and economic uncertainty continue to remain a threat to equities, supporting the bullish story of gold from a medium-term perspective. Investors will shun gold and rush to other asset classes only if macroeconomic indicators turn green. For this to happen, a COVID vaccine is vital. Besides, stimulus by governments and easing of tensions between the US and China may soften gold prices. ""Availability of the vaccine, next stimulus package by the US government, tensions and tariff war between US and China and the ability of governments to control the number of cases will guide the future course for gold,"" said Nish Bhatt, Founder and CEO, Millwood Kane International. Until them, gold will continue to march upward. ""The yellow metal loves uncertainty and in the current scenario, there is plenty of that around the world. So, the gold remains unquestionably supported by a high influx of geopolitical risks and monetary liquidity,"" said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research - Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services. ""As long as there is no COVID-19 vaccine or any development over coronavirus vaccine, the trend will be bullish. The uncertainty over the US-China trade war, more stimulus measures by both Fed and US administration and US Presidential elections will also support the gold marathon,"" he added.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/when-working-towards-financial-independence-remember-to-save-and-invest-5689751.html,When working towards financial independence remember to ‘save and invest’,"Raghvendra Nath Every year we celebrate the Independence Day with enthusiasm and gusto and remember the bravehearts who sacrificed their lives to get us our freedom. Freedom gave us the ability to pursue our dreams and aspirations. It also gave us the fundamental rights that allow us to enjoy our lives without the fear of reprisal or repression. It is so important to create similar independence in our financial situation as well. All of us would like to be financially independent; acquire material possessions like houses, cars, white goods; send our children to good schools and colleges and spend during their marriages; take holidays and spend on lifestyle needs like watches, jewellery and clothes, provide for emergencies, and finally create a good corpus for retirement. However, most of us earn a monthly income. Most of our income is spent in meeting day-to-day expenses. The only way to fulfil our aspirations is to save and invest some of our earning in a manner that they can grow substantially. I used the words ""save and invest"" for a reason. If you just save, it may allow you to accumulate some wealth but your savings would not be working hard for themselves. That is why it is important to invest your savings where they can earn a return that is reasonably higher than the prevalent rate of inflation. We should understand the difference between nominal and real returns. When you invest in a 6 percent fixed deposit, the return that you get is ""nominal"". If inflation is 4 percent, the ""real"" return is just 2 percent. And, in higher tax brackets, even this 2 percent may go away in taxes. Therefore, not taking risks at all may be alright to protect your savings but it may not allow your savings to grow after adjusting for inflation and taxes. To achieve financial independence, it is therefore paramount that you invest in high yielding assets. But, with small sums of money at our disposal, the only viable option is to invest in equity markets through institutional vehicles like mutual funds. Equities, in the long term, are the only asset class that consistently enriches investors. A study of the Indian mutual fund industry shows that on average, mutual funds multiplied money 12 to 15 times in the last 20 years. During this period, an investment in a fixed deposit would have multiplied the money four or five times only. Creating financial independence requires a lot of discipline. As a thumb rule, one should save at least 25 to 30 percent of one’s monthly earnings. Also, the younger you are, the higher percentage should be allocated towards equity investments. The journey towards financial independence is fraught with volatility. There will be times when you would feel that all your investment decisions are wrong. There will be long periods of time when you may not see any returns at all. But you should remember, that when it comes to investing, the most patient investor is always the most successful investor. The only thing that one should always be worried about in this endeavour is the quality of investments. Always focus on having the highest quality of investments. If you do not have the skills to differentiate between good and poor, it is advisable to take the help of financial advisers. Of course, financial advisers be proficient and experienced. A financial adviser is like a guide who can drive you through the complex maze of the financial world and keep you and your investments safe. Having someone qualified by your side would ensure that you do not make the mistakes that most people do and that you stay the course, in times of volatility and uncertainty as well. You earn every month. You spend every month. You should also invest every month so that you can fulfil each of your dreams and aspirations.

In July, mutual fund houses sold Rs 2,480 crore in equity schemes against an inflow of Rs 240 crore in June. The outflow in the cash segment was Rs 7,231.99 crore in July against Rs 3,689.67 crore in the previous month. The big reason was profit booking and redemption pressure as the market rallied 50 percent from March lows, though FIIs were net buyers in July (Rs 2,490.19 crore) and June (Rs 5,492.95 crore). Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said the outflow may stabilise over the next few months.

ALSO READ:   Big Story | Why are equity mutual funds seeing net outflows? ""The SIP has also been badly impacted in the current pandemic due to restricted cash flows for a number of households.

""Short duration funds, corporate bond funds, and banking and PSU funds continue to attract investor attention due to the hunt for superior risk-adjusted returns, as these funds have the most appropriate duration positioning and excellent credit risk profile,"" Thomas said. ""It is very clear that investors are avoiding longer duration probably due to the expectation that there is volatility at the long end of the curve emanating from the issue of long-dated papers at the Gilts' primary auctions.""

Meanwhile, the dollar index has declined by 3.36 percent in the same time frame. The depreciation of the Indian rupee was on account of rising number of coronavirus cases within the country which has affected the rate of recovery for the domestic economy. India's trajectory of COVID-19 cases to affect demand recovery India's daily count of COVID-19 cases have been on the rise with an average of 60,000 cases being reported daily in the country. For the period between August 1 and 8, India reported 3,99,263 new cases of coronavirus whereas the US recorded 3,84,099 cases. This was the first time when India eclipsed the US trajectory of weekly cases which has been the hardest hit nation from the virus. This unprecedented rise in cases has affected the demand prospects in India. According to the IMF India's 2020 GDP is expected to contract by 4.5 percent on account of the pandemic that stalled all activities within the country. In terms of GDP contraction, this would be historic lows for India in 2020. Meanwhile, RBI has also projected a contraction in the Indian economy for the first half of FY21 but refrained from giving any quantifiable guidance for the same. Central Banks to play a key role in this recovery US Federal Reserve's balance sheet has ballooned to nearly $7 trillion in August 2020 from $4 trillion at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. The US Fed has been using all the weapons in its arsenal to support the ailing economy from buying mortgage-backed securities to private credit. The central bank recently approved a scheme for providing loans to small non-profit organisations as well. In its latest policy meeting, the US Fed decided to hold interest rates at 0-0.25 percent till the end of 2022 to provide the necessary support for the US economy to recover in the coming future. RBI too in line with major central banks across the globe has kept its policy accommodative in order to support the Indian economy. Repo rate currently stands at 4 percent. Vaccine hopes to keep Rupee afloat The pandemic has hit almost every nation across the globe but the two most brutally hit nations have been India and US. Cases in India has been on a rise on a daily basis which is a major cause of concern for a developing nation like India. India's growth rate is likely to be in negative territory in 2020 but any hopes of mass-scale production of the virus vaccine would help in major recovery for the domestic economy. Meanwhile, FII flows into the Indian equity market turned positive since the start of May 2020 on account of ample liquidity induced by major central markets across the globe. There has been an inflow of Rs 66,156 crore in the Indian equity market from May 2020 to August 2020. Contradictorily, since the start of this pandemic, US treasury yields have fallen from 1.4 percent in February 2020 to 0.66 percent in August 2020 on account of investors hoarding towards safe-haven assets during this pandemic. Going forward, rupee's trajectory would be heavily dependent on the flows in the Indian market coupled with vaccine hopes for the COVID-19 virus. Hence, USDINR (CMP: 74.84) is likely to move in the range from 74 at the lower end of the spectrum and 76 at the higher end of the spectrum in August 2020.

Gold has witnessed sharp volatility in the last few sessions as market players assess further direction after the sharp correction. Prices have corrected sharply but despite the drop, gold has managed to hold on to $1,880-1,900 range. We are likely to see directionless trade in the near term unless there are fresh triggers. Gold was trading mixed on August 13 as support from choppy US dollar, rising US-China tensions and a spike virus cases was countered by ETF outflows, upbeat economic data, rising US bond yields, signs of progress in vaccine development and strength in the US equity market. After three days of gains, the dollar index ended lower on August 12 as support from the rise in bond yields and upbeat CPI data was offset by the uncertainty about an additional stimulus package amid political wrangling. US-China tensions have grown, dampening hopes of a breakthrough in the trade talks later this week. Rising infections continue to threaten the economic recovery. As per Reuters reports, three Fed officials noted that the US economic recovery will be slow until the coronavirus is under control, and Americans will have to manage life with the virus for at least the next several months. The sharp volatility in the gold price was enough to make investors nervous and this has resulted in some outflows. Gold holdings with SPDR ETF fell by 7.3 tonnes on August 12 to 1,250.62 tonnes, lowest since August 3. Equity markets are still on a firmer footing as data from major economies points towards continued recovery. The US 10-year bond yield surged to 0.69 percent, matching the highest level since July 6 as improved risk sentiment reduced demand for bond. While health experts are questioning the rushed approach, Russia’s claim on finding a vaccine for COVID-19 is a positive development and fuels expectations that a treatment could be found soon. Gold may witness choppy trade, however, for the day, we expect selling pressure to emerge at higher levels as ETF buying has slowed down, while the improved risk sentiment keeps bond yields and equity markets higher. NYMEX crude was trading above $42 per barrel in a narrow range after gaining 2.5 percent the previous day. Crude edged up on a positive inventory report. EIA noted a 4.512 million barrels decline in US crude oil stocks, which was higher than market expectations of 2.9 million bbl and the 4.4 million barrels decline reported by API. US crude production fell for the second consecutive week to 10.7 million barrels per day. EIA also noted a slightly bigger than expected decline in gasoline stocks and an unexpected drop in distillate stocks. The only area of concern was the sixth weekly rise in crude stocks at Cushing, the delivery terminal for NYMEX crude futures, which shows increasing glut in the region. Stocks at Cushing stand at 53.3 million barrels, highest since May. Crude oil also benefitted from gains in the US equity market amid upbeat CPI data and signs of progress in vaccine development. Weighing on crude oil is OPEC’s downbeat demand forecast. OPEC expects global demand to fall by 9.06 million barrels per day as against the previous estimate of 8.95 million bpd drop. Further highlighting weaker demand, India’s refined fuel consumption fell to 15.68 million tonnes in July, down 11.7 percent year-on-year and 3.5 percent below June’s levels, as reported by Reuters. Also weighing on prices is the prospect of higher supply from OPEC as the producer group is to reduce the pace of production cuts from August. Crude oil has edged up but is still holding within the broad range seen for the last few days. With mixed factors in place, choppy trade may continue however we expect selling pressure to emerge near $ 43 level. The focus during the day will be on IEA’s monthly outlook, the US and European economic data, development on US stimulus talks, virus outbreak and US-China tensions.

Yochana Vyapaar (noticee) was one of the entities who had indulged in creating artificial volume of 6,90,99,386 units through 614 non-genuine trades in 219 stock option contracts, as per the regulator. In its order, dated August 11, SEBI said this pattern of trades continued for 39 days. The trades by the noticee were non-genuine in nature and created a misleading appearance of trading in illiquid stock option contracts, SEBI said, adding that Yochana Vyapar indulged in creation of artificial volumes by way of reversal of trades in illiquid options contracts, where wider market participation was not involved in the trades. The trades were such that one of the counterparty books a profit while the other counterparty books a loss. Hence, it would be appropriate to consider the impact of these transactions between the two counterparties in totality, SEBI noted.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House and top Democrats in Congress may not be able to reach a deal on coronavirus aid, marking a fifth day without talks, as the stalemate blocked relief to tens of millions of Americans. The S&P 500 is about 0.9 percent below its intraday record high of 3,393.52. The benchmark index snapped seven days of gains on Tuesday after coming within 0.4 percent of its peak, powered by historic fiscal and monetary stimulus and signs of a nascent economic recovery. ""The S&P 500 got very close (to a record high), and there might be some technical resistance at that level,"" Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, said about Tuesday's move. ""But it does look like this morning, there's enough upside momentum that markets could very well be past that when they open."" The Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to bounce back to an all-time high in June. The Dow is about 6 percent below its February peak. With a better-than-feared second-quarter earnings season largely over, investors are preparing for the risk of a contested US presidential election in the fall. Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday picked Senator Kamala Harris as his choice for vice president. At 9.43 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 230.21 points, or 0.83 percent, at 27,917.12, the S&P 500 was up 30.25 points, or 0.91 percent, at 3,363.94. The Nasdaq Composite was up 115.54 points, or 1.07 percent, at 10,898.37. All major S&P sectors climbed, with financials , energy and communication services leading the charge. Latest data showed US consumer prices increased more-than-expected in July, but high unemployment is likely to keep inflation under control, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue pumping money into the economy. Tesla Inc rose 5 percent as it announced a five-for-one stock split in an attempt to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.

Australian S&P/ASX 200 futures rose 0.69% in early trading, while New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained about 0.4%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index futures rose 0.42% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 futures were flat. Those gains came after the S&P 500 jumped on Wednesday, finishing just short of its February record closing high. Analysts said while recent headlines suggest economic risks are growing, they also bolster the case for continued stimulus from Washington, which has given markets something to cheer. In a wide rally led by tech-related stocks, the Nasdaq and Dow also rose sharply. The Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to bounce back to an all-time high in June. The Dow remains below its February peak. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 EScv1 were flat. The gains on Wall Street came despite a continued impasse between lawmakers in Washington over the next economic relief package and a warning from Federal Reserve policymakers that the U.S. recovery will be gradual and slow until the coronavirus is under control. U.S. government bond yields dipped from one-month highs on Wednesday after the Treasury saw good demand for a record $38 billion auction of 10-year notes, but they remained higher on the day ahead of a 30-year bond auction on Thursday. Kim Mundy, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said Washington would continue to support the economy despite a higher then expected inflation report. “Monetary policy will remain very accommodative in the U.S. for a long time,” she wrote. The dollar index fell about 0.3% amid mixed messages from U.S. markets, and the Australian dollar fell 0.04% versus the greenback at $0.716. Ray Attrill, Head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said that “the improvement in risk sentiment has carried the day” for the Aussie after initially being dragged lower by negative news out of New Zealand and second quarter wage data. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback at 106.85 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3033, up 0.01% on the day. Oil prices climbed after government data showed U.S. oil inventories fell across the board, bolstering hopes for increased fuel demand in the world’s biggest economy. U.S. crude CLc1 recently fell 0.19% to $42.59 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was flat on the day. Save-haven precious metals recouped some of their recent losses in a choppy session.

""We estimate steel realisation to decline by 9 percent QoQ (down 17 percent YoY) due to higher exports and lower prices in the domestic markets on the resumption of activities,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which expects volumes to decline sharply by 35 percent YoY (down 33 percent QoQ) at 1.96 million tonnes during Q1 FY21, factoring the impact of COVID-19. India EBITDA per tonne may decline by 36 percent QoQ (down 36 percent YoY) due to lower realisations, Kotak said, adding that Europe EBITDA loss per tonne may come at $35 per tonne due to declining steel spreads and a sharp cut in steel volumes due to the partial shutdowns at plants.

Excluding bullion sale, revenue for the division fell 71% YoY (grammage de-growth: 81%) with sales in May, June around 20%, 72%, respectively. The company is expecting recovery rate to improve at 80% of pre-Covid levels by end of Q2FY21. The impact of pandemic was much more severe on the watches division as the segment reported revenue de-growth of 90% YoY to Rs 75.0 crore. Sales continued to remain under stress, with a recovery rate of 40% in July. Revenue from eyewear division de-grew 80% YoY to Rs 30.0 crore. Overall consolidated revenue de-grew 62% YoY to Rs 1979.0 crore. Gross margins deteriorated 550 bps YoY to 22.0% owing to lower share of studded ratio (18% vs. 25% YoY) and higher demand for plain gold jewellery. Despite sharp reduction in advertising spend (down 86% YoY), profitability in the quarter was materially impacted due to other expenses staying elevated (certain expenses pertaining to ineffective hedge that Titan did not quantify).

Revenues fell 35.6% QoQ to Rs 46107.6 crore due to sharp fall in product sales. On the refining front, core refining performance was weak as core GRMs came in at -US$0.9/bbl. Reported GRMs were at zero as inventory gain of US$0.9/bbl was reported. Marketing segment reported inventory gain of Rs 432 crore. Hence, EBITDA came in at Rs 4353.6 crore against estimate of Rs 3832 crore. Reported PAT was at Rs 2813.8 crore (our estimate: Rs 2272.2 crore) against Rs 26.8 crore in Q4FY20. Outlook Marketing sales have improved from April lows but are still lower YoY. Fuel demand in July fell MoM due to localised lockdowns and monsoon.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/trend-in-retail-participation-is-here-to-stay-7-sectors-which-robinhood-investors-should-bet-on-5683271.html,Trend in retail participation is here to stay! 7 sectors which Robinhood investors should bet on,"Calendar 2020 has been a difficult year for investors on D-Street but that did not stop retail investors to participate in the rally. Work from home culture, seamless technology platforms across brokers, and willingness to add an extra source of income amid COVID-19 pandemic fuelled retail participation on D-Street -- popularly known as Robinhood investors. Both Sensex and Nifty50 have rallied by about 50 percent from the March lows which suggests that the momentum is intact. Much of the participation on the Street has come from retail investors, and experts are of the view that the trend is here to stay. Almost 5 million new DEMAT accounts were added at the end of FY20. This came when both Sensex and Nifty50 lost more than 20 percent in March. Total Demat accounts by the end of FY2020 stood at 40.8 million, up from 35.9 million as of March 2019, as retail investors took to equities. “The number of new Demat accounts (dematerialised accounts) opened during the financial year 2020 was the most in at least a decade at 4.9 million. A 22.5 percent increase has been observed i.e. 4 million Demat accounts opened in the previous year, showed data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India,” Jashan Arora, Director Master Capital Services told Moneycontrol. “While people working from home, have time to explore trading in equities. Low prices of stocks have given the investor an opportunity to enter markets. Low bank deposit rates likewise brought new investors searching for higher returns compared to other asset classes,” he said. Data suggests that there is tremendous growth in the interest of young investors in stock markets as they consider trading a profitable investment option. Investors who are willing to take part in the journey are mostly millennials, and the composition of female investors stood at 20 percent. “When we look at the customers acquired since May, they are some clear indicators which to an extent is similar to the trend we have noticed over the past year as well. Looking at our new customer acquisitions of May, June 2020 in terms of demography: Over 60 percent of our new acquisitions are millennials (aged 24 to 40 years),” Shankar Vailaya, Director, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol. “The percentage of females is a little below 20 percent. In terms of occupation, the percentage of salaried is just below 50 percent. And, 30 percent new clients come from tier I cities – Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore,” he said. Vailaya further added that even if the WFH is lifted, the trend of increased capital market participation should continue unless the market gets unpredictable. COVID has given a lot of time to investors to read, surf on the web, chat and discover the advantages of capital markets. “The second, and which we feel will be the more prolonged factor for sustained growth in capital market participation will be the fact that interest rates/FD started falling quarters ago, pushing individuals to look for alternatives to invest their money. When you are used to getting 7-8 percent via FD and now hard reality is around 5-6 percent over 1 year you are open to new ideas including investing in equities,” he said. If you are constructing a new portfolio, here are some sectors you can look at: Expert: Harsh Jain Co-founder and COO Groww Fundamentally strong large-mid cap companies from the following sectors have the potential to generate long term wealth. Top IT companies by market cap have given returns as high as 50 percent since the lockdown. Needless to say, IT is an evergreen sector and will boom in the years to come. The government impetus to the sector under Digital India initiatives have also done their part. India is home to a large and diverse set of skilled IT professionals whose expertise is in high demand in foreign markets. That coupled with a sustained increase in demand for export of software both in domestic markets and abroad will keep the sector active. As a defensive sector, established FMCG companies have the wherewithal to stand market volatility and deliver robust performance over the long-term. Lower operational costs, wider penetration due to established distribution networks and products catering to a wide user base are some of the reasons that make this sector a good bet for the long-term. Infrastructure sub-sectors – Cement Cement stocks have performed well since the lockdown, with three-month returns touching the 30 percent mark. The government’s impetus to infrastructure projects like affordable housing etc. could spur cement demand significantly in the years to come. Chemical, Logistics Chemicals is an upcoming sector and has the potential to generate a couple of largecaps in the next 5 years. Logistics is expected to perform well in the long term as e-commerce flourishes in India. Banking and financial services are also a promising sector. Expert: Jyoti Roy, DVP Equity Strategist, Angel Broking Ltd Telecom The telecom sector should benefit from increased data demand given increasing trend of work from home along with improved pricing power. Bharti Airtel is our top picks in the telecom space. Agrochemical Agrochemicals are some of the sectors which are essential in nature and should do well given greater revenue visibility. In the agrochemical and chemical space, we prefer Aarti Industries, Galaxy Surfactants, and PI Industries. Coromandel International, Hero Morocorp, and Swaraj Engines are few of the stocks which will benefit from a resurgence in the rural economy.

The Nifty bounced back after testing 5-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) placed at 11,259. It slipped to 11,242 before bouncing back towards 11,300 to end the day 14 points lower at 11,308. The S&P BSE Sensex slipped 37 points to 38,369. Sectorally, selling pressure was seen in healthcare, consumer durables, metal, and realty stocks, while some buying was seen in auto, public sector, and consumer discretionary stocks. Experts say strong support is placed at 11,200, while on the upside, resistance is placed at 11,400-11,450  but the index has to close above 11,322 for the bulls to regain control. The Nifty50 continued lackadaisical trading as it remained in a narrow 80- point range and signed off the session with yet another indecisive candle formation. The trading bias seems to have turned negative for the near-term as the Nifty failed to get past the previous sessions high but breached the low, say experts. If the Nifty fails to get past 11,322 levels in next session and slips below 11,242, then the downswing will get extended towards 11,140 levels. A breach of it on a closing basis shall confirm short-term trend reversal in the favour of the bears, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist–Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. “As of now, it appears that unless the bulls witness a strong close above 11,322 levels, with wide intraday trading range, upward momentum will not gather pace. On such a close, strength can be expected to expand towards 11,450 levels,” he said. The short-term should initiate long positions only on a strong close above 11322, whereas intraday traders can consider shorting below 11240 and look for modest targets of 11180 or so, Mohammad said. We have collated views of experts on what investors should do on August 13 when the market resumes trading: Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director, Choice Broking The Nifty ended with a minor loss of 14 points but more importantly, it closed above 11300, which indicates a further upside movement in the upcoming session. The Nifty has been trading in an upward rising channel formation for the last few days, which also points to an upside movement with its good support of 21-day moving average. Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Ltd      The encouraging response to fundraising by lending firms has boosted investor sentiment towards banking stocks, which, in turn, is helping the benchmark to sustain at the higher levels as other sectors take a breather after a substantial rally. Since we’re largely mirroring global markets, participants will track the US stimulus package and US-China trade tension for cues. Traders should focus on the stock selection as there are enough opportunities across the board Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities The Nifty closed the day lower by 14 points lower with a small body of the positive candle. Technically, this signals formation of a high wave type pattern that indicates the bulls are holding their defence. This choppy movement below the hurdle of previous swing high could eventually result in a retesting of recent swing highs (11,373) or scale higher. The long-term charts—weekly and monthly—show the presence of strong overhead resistance around 11,400-11,500 as per the concept of change in polarity. Hence, any upside breakout attempt above 1,1400 needs to be careful with regards to an important trend reversal. The short-term uptrend status remains intact, still there is no evidence of reversal pattern at the highs. Positional longs need to be protected with a stoploss of 11,125. On the upside, 11,400-11,500 could act as a key overhead resistance in the near term. Rohan Patil, Technical Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd. For the past four months, the Nifty is trading in a rising channel formation and within that period prices have respected its lower band almost three times and successfully rallied higher.

Experts advise caution at higher levels, but if the Nifty50 holds on to 11,300 levels, a bounce-back towards 11,380-11,400 levels is possible. “Wednesday’s fall in the market was more of a reaction following the overnight fall in the US market. Currently, our market lacks strong buying conviction as interest wanes away at higher levels,” Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol. “On Thursday or in the next few days, Nifty must cross the 11,380 levels otherwise the index could slip as low as 11,100 or 11,000. However, if the Nifty 50 index reaches 11,350/11,360 levels, it would be advisable to book profit on a long position or reduce leveraged positions,” he said. More than 100 stocks on the BSE hit their fresh 52-week high that includes names like HCL Technologies, HAL, M&M, VST Tillers, GMM Pfaudler, Vaibhav Global, VST Tillers, and Orissa Minerals. We have collated views of an expert on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on August 13: Expert: Ashish Chaturmohta Head of Technicals and Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management HCL Technologies Ltd: Stock can move towards Rs 780 | Support Rs 675 The stock has been in an uptrend forming a higher top and higher bottom on the daily chart since March low of Rs 375. In the process, it crossed its previous all-time of Rs 623 with momentum and high volumes. After the last rally, the stock was sideways for the last couple of weeks. Thus, leading to a bullish pole and flag pattern on the daily chart. In Wednesday’s session, it saw a breakout and resumed its uptrend with long body bullish candle with volumes indicating buying participation in the stock. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has given a positive crossover with its average on the daily chart. On the upside, the stock can move towards Rs 780 and then possibly towards Rs 840 levels. On the downside, the recent low of Rs 675 will act as support for the stock, and a break below it correction can be seen. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd: A breakout above Rs 1,000 will act as support  The stock was in a downtrend since its listing in 2018 around Rs 1,150 to low of Rs 470 in March this year. In the last five months, the stock has rallied from the lows on high volumes and strong momentum. It has formed a base below Rs 1,000 levels and has given a breakout on the upside. Now, the stock can test its all-time high of Rs 1,185 and probably head higher towards Rs 1,300 levels. On the downside, a breakout level of Rs 1,000 will act as support for the stock. M&M: Price needs to sustain above Rs 600-590 support levels The stock has been in a steady uptrend forming a higher top and higher bottom on the daily chart since its March low of Rs 245. Volumes were high at lower levels indicating accumulations at lower levels. Price has crossed 50 percent (Rs 620) of the major decline from Rs 993 to Rs 245. It has also crossed the resistance zone around 600 levels. Thus, we can expect the price to move towards the next resistance level of Rs 710. On the downside, the price needs to sustain above Rs 600-590 support levels for stock to move higher. VST Tillers: Price can move towards Rs 1,840 and Rs 1,970 levels  Since March low of Rs 588, the stock has been in an uptrend forming a higher top and higher bottom on the daily chart. Volumes have been high on upmove indicating buying participation in the stock. Earlier, Rs 1,300-1,400 zone was acting as a resistance for the stock indicating as supply zone. Now after 6-7 weeks of narrow consolidation below this resistance stock has seen a breakout on the upside with volumes and momentum. Thus, the stock has formed a base at lower levels and has seen a breakout on the upside. Now price can move towards Rs 1,840 and Rs 1,970 levels. On the downside Rs 1,450 and Rs 1,350 will act as support for the stock. InterGlobe Aviation: Support for the stock is seen at Rs 925 and Rs 875 levels The stock witnessed a sharp decline from the all-time high of Rs 1898 to Rs 800 odd levels in March. Since then, the stock is seeing a bounce back from Rs 875-800 odd zone on multiple occasions indicating a strong support zone and value area for the stock. On Wednesday, the stock has seen a bounce back from the lower end with a long body bullish candle and high volumes indicating buying participation at lower levels.

At this juncture, investors may want to sell underperformers and switch to market leaders across industry segments, Sahil Kapoor ,  Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Professional Investor Research, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand. Edited excerpt: Q) Independence Day is around the corner. Amid the pandemic, how important is financial independence for investors, and how best they can attain it?  A) Financial independence is a goal, which is absolutely worth pursuing. Over the years, India has witnessed an increased awareness about various ways to become financially independent, apart from traditional ideas of savings. The current pandemic has laid bare, the critical role of a well-diversified, low volatility portfolio along with a contingency fund that plays a crucial role in our material well-being and peace of mind. The first step towards financial independence is self-inquiry. One must introspect on lifetime milestones, family needs, and emergency covers. Once the risks and costs associated with these events are understood, one must plan their investing journey accordingly. A slow and steady approach to financial independence helps create an investment portfolio replete with a mix of equity, debt, and a small portion of alternates. In addition to this, one must look to cover emergency requirements with health insurance, life term cover, and a cash equivalent contingency fund. Q) Some new NFOs have been launched recently to tap US markets. Do you think that investing abroad is a must in one’s portfolio? What are the factors which one should watch before investing in overseas funds?  A) India has a very large number of opportunities and ideally it is a market that can address all the needs of an average Indian investor. But, to add an edge of diversification, one can choose to invest in overseas funds based on their investment horizon and risk appetite. In addition to being careful regards instrument selection that matches your capabilities to understand nuances in foreign investment, keep an eye out for regulatory requirements, tax implications, and cash flows. Q) Gold surpassed $2000/ounce just last week. Equity markets are also up by about 50% from the March lows, but will still beat Equity Asset Class hands down in 2020. Do you think investors should tweak their portfolio allocation strategy? A) Gold has proven to be a valuable portfolio component over time. Because of the lumpy nature of returns and tough to time characteristic of this asset class, it requires a steady portion of portfolio allocation. After its recent stupendous performance, it is advisable to wait for Gold prices to correct. Q) Someone who is already invested or long in the market since March, what would you advise – book profits or hold for more potential gains?  A) Long term investors should stay invested and practice a buy on dips strategy. At this juncture, investors may want to sell-off underperformers and switch to market leaders across industry segments. Q) What is your target for the yellow metal for the year 2020, and how can investors leverage the share momentum which this asset class is seeing? A) Gold appears to be in a favorable trend for the next two years. However, for 2020, a large part of the gains, have been realized. It may consolidate for a while at its life highs and may undergo a price and time correction. In short, further gains may take a while to come. Q) Which are you re-rating themes in markets and why? Or sectors which could get rerated as economic normalizes? A) Sectors and stocks in Pharma, healthcare may benefit from pandemic related shifts towards health. Once economic growth stabilizes, stocks in consumer discretionary sectors like auto, pipes, electronics, and personal care, may do well.

There is not much progress in this week’s daily chart compared to its previous week's charts. On August 12, both Nifty and Bank Nifty opened almost a percent lower and later on a constant buying support in some heavyweight stocks, pushed Nifty closer to yesterday's close.

On August 11, India VIX index witnessed a breakdown of the smaller degree trendline on the daily interval and on August 12, it continued its breakdown trend and contracted by 2.41 percent, closing below 21 levels. Market breadth remained strongly in favour of bulls. For five gainers, there were three losers. There are expectations of a good announcement on taxation, health care, new FDI announcement and dedicated financial institution for the infrastructure funding. We expect some consolation at the current level with time-wise correction. The breakdown below 11,100 could trigger a further supply till 10,850. Resistance is near 11,375, a break of this level will open the gate for 10,600 on the benchmark index.

The majority of indicators and oscillators are showing a positive trend for the current scenario. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,428-1,440 for the target of Rs 1,690. SRF | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,147 | Target price: Rs 4,600 | Stop loss: Rs 3,950 | Upside: 11% On the daily chart, SRF has given a breakout from the consolidation pattern, sustaining above all its major exponential moving averages.

But after the correction in the dollar index and weaker-than-expected UK GDP data, both the precious metals recovered from their lows. Gold and silver settled flat in the international market. On MCX, after touching a low of Rs 49,955, gold recovered to settle above Rs 52,200. Silver also made a low of Rs 60,910 but recovered in the evening session to settle at around Rs 67,000. “Higher than expected US CPI and Core CPI data, weakness in the dollar index and varied voices on Russian coronavirus vaccine supported precious metals at lower levels. We expect both the precious metals to remain volatile in Thursday’s session,” Manoj Jain, Director (Head - Commodity & Currency Research) at Prithvi Finmart told Moneycontrol. “At MCX, gold has crucial support at 51,500 on a closing basis, which is expected to be held. If prices sustain above 52,220, gold could extend the gains towards 52,550-52,800 levels again,” he said. For MCX silver, 64,500 was the crucial support. If prices sustain above 67,200, gains could extend towards 68,500-69,800 levels, he said. “We suggest buy-on-dip in both the precious metals as weakness in the dollar index continues to support precious metals at lower levels,” Jain said. Trading Strategy Expert: Ravindra Rao, VP- Head Commodity Research at Kotak Securities Comex December gold contract was trading largely unchanged near $1,947 per oz after a 0.1 percent gain the previous day. Gold traded mixed as support from choppy US dollar, rising US-China tensions and a spike in virus cases was countered by ETF outflows, upbeat economic data, rising US bond yields, signs of progress in vaccine development and strength in the US equity market. Gold may witness choppy trade unless there are fresh triggers but the general bias may be on the downside in the near term as higher yields support the dollar. Expert: Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities International spot gold and silver ended with gains in volatile trade on August 12, supported by the fall in the Dollar and safe-haven appeal as an impasse continues over a second US stimulus package. Domestic bullion could extend gains on August 13, tracking a firm start in the overseas prices. However, prices could remain volatile and witness consolidation in the coming sessions. Technically, MCX October gold resistance holds at 52,600-53,350 and support is at 51,700-50,550 levels. Disclaimer ",stocks,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 09:42 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/these-27-stocks-turned-multibaggers-since-last-independence-day-do-you-own-them-5689161.html,These 27 stocks turned multibaggers since last Independence Day; do you own any?,"The benchmark indices registered stellar rally of 50 percent each in last four-and-half-months. But the picture is different when we compare the performance of last 12 months - i.e. from last Independence Day 2019. The BSE Sensex gained only 2.4 percent since the last Independence Day, underperforming the broader indices with the BSE Midcap (up 6.26 percent) and Smallcap (up 9.8 percent) in the same period. The government immediately after Independence Day 2019 took several measures to revive the economic growth which was badly hit by liquidity and NPA concerns, including cut in corporate tax, liquidity support to banking & financials space etc. US-China trade tensions also cooled off with signing first phase of deal. As a result the benchmark indices hit a record high in January. But the outbreak of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus gripped the world and the equity markets. As a result, the Indian equities fell 40 percent from all-time highs achieved in January to March lows. This was followed by a 50 percent recovery from March lows. More than 90 percent stocks in all key indices have turned positive from March lows, but in the last one year, the ratio is 50:50, i.e. in BSE Sensex 50 percent stocks are in the green and the rest in the red. Same is the case with BSE 500 index, in which nearly 200 stocks reported double-digit gains from last Independence Day and of that 80 stocks climbed over 50 percent. After filtering further, top 27 stocks turned multibaggers in last one year as they gave 100-677 percent returns. These include Adani Green Energy, GMM Pfaudler, Dixon Technologies, Granules India, Navin Fluorine, Essel Propack, IndiaMart InterMesh, Affle India, Birlasoft, Escorts, Coromandel International and Deepak Nitrite. Note : Closing price of August 14, 2019 and August 12, 2020 considered in above table to check returns from last Independence Day If we just go through the list of gainers, most of those stocks were from sectors like pharma, chemical, electronics, technology, e-commerce etc. ""Most of these stocks have got a potential to grow in near future. The last year had been beneficial with a lot of stimulus from the government along with bullish benchmark indices. In addition to it, the economic condition was normal for a large part of the period. COVID crisis although disrupted the business, but the unlock phase seems to have given chance for recovery with new opportunities especially for Pharma, Chemical, Logistics and IT industries,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol. Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities too feels sectors like Pharma, Telecom and Chemical can continue to perform well for next few quarters. In the BSE Sensex, top gainers in last one year were Reliance Industries (67 percent) and Bharti Airtel (53 percent), followed by Nestle India, Sun Pharma, HCL Technologies, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever and M&M which gained 20-38 percent. On the other side, around 190 stocks in the BSE500 index reported double digit decline from last Independence Day and of which top 33 stocks were down in the range of 50-75 percent including Future Retail, Arvind Fashions, Dish TV India, PNB Housing Finance, SpiceJet Indian Bank, Century Textiles, Omaxe, IndusInd Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Raymond, Somany Ceramics, Repco Home Finance, Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, RBL Bank, Sunteck Realty, J&K Bank, PC Jeweller etc. The list showed that sectors which affected by the novel coronavirus-led lockdown hit the most including retail, housing finance, PSU banks, real estate, textile etc. ""Sectors like textile, real estate and related sectors, midcap banks; hotel & tourism have been majorly affected by lockdown and have no advantages with unlocking plan as the pandemic is still raging and supply chains have broken down. Each of these sectors is underperforming and we expect they would stay same way for few more months of this year. Altogether we see some sectors have gone out of fashion,"" Prashanth Tapse said. Foreign institutional investors were net sellers from last Independence Day largely due to major liquidity outflow in March 2020. They net sold Rs 42,677.4 crore worth of shares in last one year period, but at the same time, domestic institutional investors provided great support to Indian equities given the potential especially after several measures announced by the government to boost economy. DIIs have net bought Rs 92,836.56 crore of shares so far. Overall experts feel the valuations look expensive at current levels as the growth after measures taken by government and unlocking process is yet to be seen in data points but the market generally captured the expected scenario 2-3 quarters in advance. Hence they expect the market, barring intermittent corrections, to remain buoyant in coming years. ""We believe that from a 2-5 year perspective, the current pandemic provides an opportunity to the government to come up with reforms that can drive the markets up significantly,"" Santosh Singh, Head of Research at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company said.

The impact on IITS was due to an issue in one large travel client (down ~80% QoQ); ex-travel, its revenue was up 1.2% sequentially. Sonata has invested in strengthening the Microsoft relationship, which has yielded positive results (4Y CAGR of 19%). Dynamics D365 related services (34% of revenue) has grown at an eight-quarter CQGR of 7.8%. Furthermore, the margin expansion in IITS was led by a reduction in cost, offshoring and higher IP-Led revenue. The IITS margin will be maintained in the range of 21-22%. DPS growth was strong (+12.2% QoQ), but higher discounts impacted margins. Higher cloud license sales should lead to growth in DPS, but discounts could impact profitability.

For Q1FY21, GIL reported a consolidated topline of Rs 409 crore (down 58% YoY, 32% QoQ), compared to our estimate of Rs 335 crore.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/promoters-of-30-companies-reduce-pledged-shares-in-q1-worth-a-look-5668301.html,Promoters of 30 companies reduce pledged shares in Q1; worth a look?,"The pledged holdings of promoters in BSE500 companies declined sharply in June quarter to 1.95 percent of total promoter holding from 2.34 percent in the March quarter. Promoters of 89 companies in the BSE500 index had pledged all or part of their holdings in the June 2020 quarter compared to 105 companies in the March 2020 quarter, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. According to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities, there are about 30 companies whose promoters reduced their pledged shares. These include Dish TV, Wockhardt, Future Retail, Jindal Saw, Apollo Tyres and Adani Ports.   Usually, a fall in promoter pledge is considered as a positive sign, but analysts feel that the reasons for a fall in promoter pledge could be completely different. “Generally, as a trend in a rising interest rate scenario, promoters often use shares owned by them as collateral for loans. But in order to help the languishing economy in the wake of coronavirus, RBI has been slashing repo rates, now at its lowest ever at 4.40%,” Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol. “Therefore, in a scenario where the economy is flush with liquidity and interest rates have fallen, promoters often tend to take the benefit. This reduction in promoter pledge was also accentuated by an increase in the price of the underlying asset pledged with the financial institution, in this case, shares pledged,” she said. Shah further added that with the given data it can be safely concluded that reduction in prevailing interest rates along with a rise in share prices from March 2020 lows have accelerated the fall in promoter pledges in June. The decline in the number of promoters’ pledged companies can be attributed to changes in BSE-500 constituents and the complete release of pledged shares in case of a few companies, said the report. The value of promoter pledged holdings was Rs 1.3 trillion at the end of June. Kotak Institutional Equities clarifies that pledging of shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; banks (lenders) could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares. Companies whose promoters pledged more than 90 percent of their holdings include names like Future Consumer, Max Financial Services, Emami, Jindal Stainless (Hissar), and Dish TV. Rise in promoter pledge in June quarter: The highest increase in pledged promoter holdings was seen in DB Corp., Zee Entertainment, Metropolis Healthcare, Ashok Leyland, Emami, SPARC, and Jamna Auto Industries. Investors should ideally stay away from companies in which promoters’ pledged holdings increase. “As a thumb rule, retail investors should make note that large scale pledging of shares by promoters in either a falling or a rising market scenario is a matter of great concern as it adds substantial risks to one’s wealth creation journey,” says Shah of Samco Securities. “Retail investors are advised to avoid investing in companies that have witnessed an increase in promoter pledges. It is safer to invest your capital in other stocks. As Murphy’s Law states ‘Anything that can go wrong will go wrong’ and the world of investing is no exception,” she said.

At the same time, the trading in Rights Entitlement shares, allotted to eligible shareholders as per data available on record date of August 5, also begin on the same day, while the investors can renounce or transfer their Rights Entitlement by August 21. The non-banking finance company, which provides individual & small business loans and savings services, has fixed the issue price at Rs 60 per equity share, which is around 14 percent discount to August 11's closing price. Experts feel the issue is decently priced but they are mixed in their opinion while advising for subscription. ""Investors can subscribe to the issue as the company is trading at a very lucrative price. Its PE is at 3.36 which is low compared to other NBFCs. Issue is placed at a very decent price. There is a scope of appreciation in valuations and stock might give good returns in mid to long term,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol. Fundamentally, the company has seen healthy growth in its assets under management (AUM) which stood at Rs 8,174 crore in FY20. Satin Creditcare reported net profit of Rs 155 crore in 2019-20, down 23 percent from Rs 201 crore in the year-ago period. Also read  -  Satin Creditcare Network rights issue to open on August 12; 10 key things to know The stock corrected sharply in the last one year as well as year-to-date (2020), down 72 percent and 64 percent respectively. The major reason is the lockdown due to COVID-19 which stalled their day-to-day activities including collection of amount. Satin Creditcare is a small cap NBFC-MFI company serving the under-privileged segments of the society and remained focused on driving financial inclusion. With Pan India presence, Satin has been growing distribution network to service the unique needs of over 3.6 mn clients on consolidated basis. Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities also feels the rights issue offer is decently priced at a discount of around 17 percent to August 10's price, but he is cautious on Satin Creditcare business prospects due to low promoter holding (30.19 percent as of June 2020), higher provisions in the wake of COVID-19 and expected rise in gross non-performing assets & net non-performing assets (NPA) in coming quarter's earnings. In general he believes promoters with low shareholding and share pledge in the company may find it difficult to build confidence in the investor's community. Hence considering basic parameters, he advised existing shareholders/investors to sell Rights Entitlement (RE) shares offered in the ratio of 48:125. Participants have to make a payment of Rs 15 per rights equity share (i.e.25 percent of issue price) at the time of submitting application by August 26, and the rest Rs 45 per rights equity share will be paid later (for which one or more subsequent calls as may be determined by the board/committee of the board, from time to time). Company is going to use issue proceeds for augmenting capital base to meet future capital requirements and funding requirements for growth of the business and operations (over Rs 89 crore); and general corporate purposes.

The Sensex ended 224.93 points higher at 38,407.01, while Nifty rose 52.30 points to close at 11,322.50. Amara Raja Batteries | Brokerage: Emkay | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 742.50 | Target: Rs 803 | Upside: 8 percent | Amid weakness in the auto sector in FY21E, a swift recovery is expected in the battery segment, led by a pickup in replacement demand. Volumes should improve gradually in Industrial/OEM segments ahead. Also, Emkay expects market share gains to continue for the company and expect a 10%/15% CAGR in revenue/earnings over FY20-23E, with average ROCE of 24% and FCF of Rs5bn/year. Rallis India | Brokerage: Emkay | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 305.55 | Target: Rs 335 | Upside: 9 percent. The company plans backward integration for two of its key molecules and would manufacture the intermediate itself over the next two years. Management also guided that demand for pendimethalin remains robust in volume terms despite lower realisation. Broking house remains positive on stock as management's focus on CRAMS opportunity, filling portfolio gaps in the crop care and seeds business should augur well over the medium-term. JK Lakshmi Cement | Brokerage: ICICIdirect | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 283.45 | Target: Rs 330 | Upside: 16 percent. JK Lakshmi’s Q1 FY21 performance remained above estimates mainly on account of better-than-expected sales volume for the quarter. Plant utilisation was at 65 percent for the quarter led by improved sales volumes during May-June. The balance sheet continues to remain healthy with D/E of 0.6 and RoIC expected to reach 20% by FY22E. Furthermore, current levels imply that JK Lakshmi Cement is trading at an EV/t of 43 and 5.2x FY22E EV/EBITDA, thus providing valuation comfort. Divis Laboratories | Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,135.75 | Target: Rs 3,350 | Upside: 6 percent. Broking house raised its EPS estimate by 16%/13% for FY21/FY22E to factor favorable demand for the company's APIs, margin enhancement owing to an increase in the in-house manufacturing of intermediates, and additional revenue from new capex. It expects a 33 percent earnings CAGR over FY20–22E, led by increased business prospects from Custom Synthesis and Generics as well as 600 bp margin expansion on better operating leverage. Birla Corporation | Brokerage: AnandRathi | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 592.05 | Target: Rs 830 | Upside: 40 percent. The company's cement and jute divisions hit by the lockdown and cyclone Amphan, Birla Corp’s revenue/EBITDA/PAT fell 35%/39%/53% y/y. Frequent local lockdowns and floods in Bihar are hurting demand. While the Kundanganj expansion continues to be postponed, the board of directors approved to expand Durgapur GU capacity by 0.24m ton by Q3 FY23 whereas Yavatmal expansion to commence by Q2 FY22. This will keep leverage high, however, AnandRathi expects, net D/E of 0.79x in FY22 (vs 0.77x a year ago) on improved profitability. HPCL | Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 215.10 | Target: Rs 304 | Upside: 41 percent. The company has reiterated that overall business is a function of both refining and marketing margins, which tends to normalise in the longer term. The company has made a strong dividend payout of 80 percent in FY20, with a dividend yield at 4.6 percent. However, owing to higher capex, FCF generation for the company is forecasted to remain negative. M&M | Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 629.25 | Target: Rs 720 | Upside: 14 percent. Mahindra & Mahindra’s (MM) Q1 FY21 earnings were driven by strong performance in the tractor business. Demand recovery was most prominent in tractors, which has led to supply constraints. While the company's core business would recover faster, the focus on tightening capital allocation could act as a re-rating catalyst. Hence, broking house sees twin levers of EPS growth and re-rating. Despite its recent outperformance, valuations are still at a substantial discount to its 5-year average. Titan Company | Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,066.50 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Upside: 22 percent. Impact of higher-than-expected depreciation and interest costs along with the impact of ineffective hedges has led to a 6 percent decline in EPS forecasts for FY21. However, the gradual improvement in the outlook for the jewellery business (over 80 percent of sales) has led us to increase in FY22E EPS by 6 percent. Likelihood of recovery in Q3 FY21 versus management guidance of Q4 FY21 seems likely, particularly due to the bunching up of postponed wedding demand, in addition to traditionally strong demand for wedding jewellery, in Q3 FY21, and festive demand. Mahanagar Gas | Brokerage: Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 971.10 | Target: Rs 1,380 | Upside: 42 percent. Earnings to recover sharply over FY22E-FY23E as gas sales volumes likely to normalise and margins rise. It is the cheapest CGD stock with attractive valuation of 11.3x FY22E EPS. The valuation gap with peers to narrow on expected revival in volumes, superior margin and FCF yield of 7 percent. Ramco System | Brokerage: Dolat Capital | Rating: Buy | LTP: Rs 165.35 | Target: Rs 250 | Upside: 51 percent. Result commentary and performance both has been a positive surprise and has led to the restoration of our growth/estimates largely back to pre-pandemic levels. Also, positive newsflow on execution in terms of faster deployment would help it pace up the revenue recognition. We expect flattish revenue performance in Q2 as surprise growth in Aviation would normalise while the traction in Logistic-ERP improves. The profitability is also likely to normalize to a large degree as some office return to operations, travel begins and marketing spends are increased to chase growth.

Shares of the company have been witnessing traction after brokerages showed faith in the company's cost-saving endeavours and expressed that green shoots are emerging for the company even as recovery is away by at least 2-3 quarters. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 33. As per the brokerage, the company's June quarter earnings were significantly above the estimates. ""Lemon Tree's cost-saving initiatives have aided in achieving positive EBITDA. This is commendable in our view, especially at a time when hotel players have either reported or are likely to post EBITDA loss. Although EBITDA was above our estimates, we have maintained our FY21/22E estimates as Q1 FY21 is not expected to contribute materially to FY21 EBITDA,"" Motilal Oswal said. The company plans to spend Rs 8-10 crore in FY21 toward CAPEX. It currently has cash and cash equivalents of Rs 225 crore. Debt repayment in FY21/FY22E would be nearly Rs 50-105 crore, Motilal Oswal said. Kotak Institutional Equities also has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 35. The brokerage highlighted that the impact on the hotel sector due to the current COVID-19 linked lockdown will likely have a longer-lasting impact even post easing of travel restrictions with some structural loss of demand as well. However, the brokerage added that the cost reduction endeavours, limited occupancy and positive EBITDA achieved by the company, and capital infusion by a long-term investor such as APG Real Estate fund are positive for Lemon Tree. ICICI Direct, on the other hand, has a hold call on the stock with a target price of Rs 26. ",markets,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 04:05 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/silver-corrects-from-multiyear-high-but-upward-momentum-intact-kotak-securities-5685281.html,Silver corrects from multiyear high but upward momentum intact: Kotak Securities,"Ravindra Rao Silver has garnered a lot of attention in the last few days with its spell-binding rally. After a subdued first six months, the metal has rallied more than 65 percent since July to hit the highest level since 2013, just short of the $30-per ounce mark. Silver rallied as gold rose to record highs, increasing its appeal as it has a correlation with the yellow metal gold but much cheaper. Silver also benefited from strong ETF inflows and improving outlook for industrial demand as manufacturing activity picked up in China and globally. But, like the swift rise, the metal has seen a sharp correction as well—the price has fallen more than 7 percent in three trading sessions from about $29.86 to about $27.8 per ounce. The big reason for the fall in silver is the correction in gold prices. Gold halted just below the key level of $2,100 per ounce and corrected as the dollar bounced back from the lows. ETF outflows also showed some profit-taking by silver investors but the pace was modest. The dollar recovered on better-than-expected US non-farm payrolls data while growing US-China tensions added to its safe-haven appeal. Silver moved up too sharply in a short time and a correction was overdue. Whether the correction will continue will depend on the dollar. The US dollar has come off the lows but will need strong positive factors to build the momentum. In the near term, the focus will be on US economic data, stimulus talks, China tensions and the virus situation. In the near term, focus will be on the stimulus discussion and US-China tensions. American policymakers have stepped up efforts to reach a consensus on the stimulus package and market players are hopeful of a deal being sealed. The US and Chinese officials are to discuss trade and other issues on August 15 but no major breakthrough is expected as ties have worsened over the last few days. With the dollar showing some signs of recovery, silver and other commodities may witness some correction. However, a sharp fall is unlikely as investor interest remains strong as recovery hopes have improved the outlook for industrial demand.

The move could witness some acceleration only above 11,377 towards 11,460-11,500 zone in the coming sessions. On its daily scale, regular occurrences of Doji formations is also significant as, of late, the price action has been away from its 5-day EMA along with its RSI approaching the overbought zone again. Technically, the index is expected to swing above the upper bound of the broadening formation placed around 11,377 and move towards the 11,500 zone. While weakness, if any, would need validation below 11,000. As broadening formation is a consolidative pattern, it is ideal to remain cautious hereon and restrict trades to intraday and short term with more emphasis on stock-specific trade setups on either side. Major trend weakness or distortion would only be valid once below 10,880 for any larger degree corrective move, until then expect confined action within 11,000-11,500 during the week.

The stock also remains one of the outperformers from its pack. It has been regularly witnessing flag formations (continuation pattern) in its journey from its major breakout zone around Rs 50.

Lenders, it seems, will have to endure a lot in days to come. While credit growth is falling, the threat of swelling NPAs is growing as there is still uncertainty on the part of pandemic and economic recovery. The 21st issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR), July 2020 of the Reserve Bank of India, presented a grim picture of the status of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India. The stress test conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is indicative of the fact that the challenging situation posed by COVID-19 could result in the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) increasing to 12.5 percent by March 2021 as against 8.5 percent in March 2020. As per Standard and Poor's estimates (June 2020), gross NPA could rise to 13-14 percent for India. However, large private sector banks look well-positioned to endure this pain and that is the reason, analysts disapprove of the idea of avoiding them completely. ""Investors should not blankly avoid the full sector, as the sector has few operationally well-managed companies and in an uncertain environment, investors can buy top banks at a lower valuation,"" Parmar pointed out. He is of the view that in this environment, the ability to raise sufficient liquidity at a competitive rate, capacity to absorb expected provision for bad loans and adequate capital adequacy will determine the performance of the bank going forward.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/how-smallcase-publisher-is-helping-retail-investors-bet-on-differentiated-portfolios-5684451.html,How Smallcase Publisher is helping retail investors bet on differentiated portfolios,"Making money in stock markets is hard, especially when you have more than 5,000 companies to choose from. There are two ways in which one could build their portfolio – a) DIY investing, and b) Getting someone to manage it for you. The second option is the easy one and most sought after as most of the retail investors don’t have the time and the skills to choose the right stocks for their portfolio, which also fits their risk profile. To bridge the gap between investing and research – ready-made equity portfolios from SEBI-registered Research Analysts, Research Investment Advisors, brokerage firms etc. have made it very simple for retail investors who are looking for a quality researched strategy in an affordable & transparent manner Many of these portfolios are being offered as smallcases that can be transacted on leading brokerage/broking platforms, and are based on differentiated strategies that could add diversification to your portfolio For instance, for strong corporate governance - the  “High-Quality Companies”  smallcase is a portfolio of fast-growing quality businesses run by competent promoters that is built by Prescient Capital, a SEBI-regd RIA founded by a team that led the public equities practice at SAIF Partners, one of India’s leading private equity funds. Another smallcase called  “Listed Venture Capital”  managed by LotusDew, a SEBI RIA, seeks to filter microcap stocks with quality governance. There are also strategies like momentum (4 smallcases managed by Alok Jain of  Weekend Investing , who has been developing systematic rule based investing strategies for over 2 decades), asset allocation (equity-debt with  IndexAlpha  from QED Capital, equity-debt-gold with  All Weather Investing smallcase ),  COVID resilient portfolio  from IIFL Securities & a lot more These smallcases are powered by a SaaS-based technology platform called the  smallcase Publisher Platform  which enables fee-based advisors to offer ready-made portfolios to their clients with past performance, ratios & risk-levels computed by the system. Research providers get a dedicated website with their branding, to showcase these smallcases. The Publisher platform acts as an end-to-end subscription management tool by automating the complete subscription flow, risk profiling questionnaire, payment collection, GST-compliant invoice generation and automated emails for rebalances, subscription confirmation, etc. Through the Publisher platform, advisors can also track the networth of their client portfolios without any manual inputs from the client. This also enables them to charge on the basis of the client’s investment value in the portfolio. The investing process is seamless for clients as after subscribing, one can invest in the constituents of the smallcase with their existing trading & demat account with brokerages and track the performance & perform other actions separately in their brokerage interface. Smallcase Technologies has partnered with 9 leading brokerages - including Zerodha, HDFC Securities, Kotak Securities, AxisDirect and IIFL. Prior to this, advisors used to share the research with their clients through email or spreadsheets, with the clients having to enter each trade individually on their respective broker platform. Moreover, this process had to be repeated for each portfolio update (rebalance). Since the launch of the Publisher Platform in early 2019, over 100K+ smallcases have been bought that were built by a wide spectrum of 50+ fee-based advisors & research firms. These smallcases can be found here -  smallcase.com/creators The Publisher platform is one of the offerings from smallcase Technologies, a fin-tech startup that builds infrastructure & technology platforms for the capital markets industry to help participants like brokerages, advisors & distribution platforms connect with each other.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/as-market-valuations-turn-expensive-brokerages-pick-these-27-stocks-5682731.html,"As market valuations turn expensive, brokerages pick these 27 stocks","The benchmark indices have given stellar 50 percent return each in just four months with Nifty Price-to-earnings ratio turning from negative 1 standard deviation (SD) in March 2020 to positive 1 standard deviation in August 2020. After recording a high of 12,430 in January, Nifty fell 40 percent to 7,511 in March due to COVID-19 crisis. Many countries around the world announced partial or complete lockdowns in the first half of the year to contain the spread of COVID-19. This brought economic activities to a jolting halt hurting corporate earnings. From the low point, the index jumped 50 percent to hit 11,300 in July, thanks to the liquidity pumped in by global central banks. Other factors that were at play are progress on vaccine for COVID-19, increasing economic activity during unlock and better-than-expected-to-in-line earnings growth in June quarter. Experts feel the valuations definitely turned expensive, but on the other hand, the economic environment has also started improving. ""Equity valuations after hitting -1 SD in March 2020 have swung to +1 SD – a function of the sharp rise in stock prices, equally sharp drop in post COVID-19 earnings and time value (four months rolled forward). In our view, evidence of a slow but surely improving global economic environment, earnings beat in Q1FY21 so far and continued commitment by central banks for further QE while maintaining record low interest rates – have the potential to keep markets expensive in the near term,"" ICICI Securities said. Equity markets have continued to be expensive in the post QE era (post 2010) with shallow corrections, it added. US Federal Reserve and the ECB, in their latest policy meet in July, remained committed to quantitative easing (QE) with an accommodative stance and maintained low interest rates. In fact, there has been negotiations between Democrats and Republican for another stimulus package in the United States as the impact of first package of around $3 trillion announced in May has been reducing, which could lift markets further. Having said that, ICICI Securities does acknowledge that the expensive P/E is also a function of bottom of the cycle earnings level (listed space PAT-to-GDP of around 2 percent in FY20) and other broader/balance sheet valuation metrics like Market Cap to GDP and P/B remain below average at 73 percent and 2.7x respectively. Given the sharp rally, experts feel the upside from here on seems to be limited but select quality stocks could continue their strong journey along with outperformance in broader space compared to benchmark indices. ""Given the high P/E valuations, our 1-year forward returns expectation from the benchmark Nifty50 remains in low single digit, while select stocks will continue to generate alpha,"" ICICI Securities said. Its top picks are  Bharti Airtel ,  Ultratech Cement ,  HDFC Bank ,  Kotak Mahindra Bank ,  SBI Life Insurance ,  TVS Motor Company ,  Balkrishna Industries ,  HPCL ,  NTPC ,  Bajaj Consumer ,  Abbott India ,  Alkem Labs  and  Century Plyboards . In muted earnings expectations for Q1FY21, beats were much higher than misses and that was one of major reasons and confidence booster for equity market not only in India but globally. ""Q1 Nifty50 results sanguine thus far with earning beats significantly outpacing misses (Beats 20, Neutral 6 and Misses 6). Free float NIFTY50 numbers – YoY Sales/NII growth of -23 percent, operating profit of 0 percent and PAT growth of -20 percent,"" ICICI said. Motilal Oswal also in its August report said Q1FY21 earnings of 91 MOFSL Universe and 33 Nifty companies that had announced their results as of August 1, 2020 came in above expectations. ""For the 33 Nifty companies, sales/EBITDA/PBT/PAT declined 27.7/1.1/22.2/18 percent (versus estimates decline of 27.3/5.9/31.0/26.1 percent YoY). Of the 33 Nifty companies that declared their results, on the PAT front, 17 have surpassed, 8 have missed, and 8 have met our expectations,"" the brokerage explained. Motilal Oswal feels the strong cost control has been the defining theme for Q1FY21 earnings so far. ""In these challenging times when demand is weak and uncertain, corporate India has employed the lever of cost reduction to alleviate the stress on the bottomline. More importantly, the corporate commentary does indicate MoM improvement from the complete lockdown in April (to May and June)."" With a significant recovery in markets from March 2020 lows and Nifty ex-BFSI crossing pre-COVID-19 levels, the brokerage also feels the risk-reward looks unattractive with valuations at 21x one-year forward Nifty EPS. Its top ideas in largecaps are  HUL ,  Infosys ,  Bharti Airtel ,  ICICI Bank ,  Titan ,  M&M ,  Wipro ,  Dabur , and in midcaps,  AU Small Finance Bank ,  Tata Consumer Products ,  Alkem Labs ,  L&T Infotech ,  Gujarat Gas ,  Teamlease ,  Motherson Sumi  and  ICICI Securities . Meanwhile, unlike Europe, China and the US, where the first wave of COVID-19 has peaked, India and parts of Latin America continue to register the highest additions of new cases, which is hampering faster economic recovery, feels the brokerage. India reported more than 22 lakh confirmed infections with more than 45,200 deaths, as per Johns Hopkins University, while the globally infections reached 2 crore mark with over 7.3 lakh deaths. But the good part so far is that the fear of second wave has not seen yet in peaked regions. ""Regions that have completed the first wave of COVID-19 (China, Europe and the US) have not seen any major second wave flare up till now. However, Latin America and Asia-Pacific are yet to peak out in terms of the first wave,"" ICICI Securities said. ",markets,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 04:37 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

On August 11, MCX gold slumped over 5 percent on weakness in international market, firmness in Indian rupee and weaker physical demand. Gold has rallied sharply in the international market in the last few days, testing new highs. The sharp rally in a short span of time made gold vulnerable to profit taking. The selloff was triggered by a rise in US bond yields, firmness in the dollar, ETF outflows and Russia’s claim of a vaccine for COVID-19. The dollar index managed to end higher for the third day on August 11, pulling back from 2018 lows set last week. The dollar benefitted from the rise in bond yields, better than expected PPI data and increased safe-haven demand amid rising US-China tensions. Gold holdings with SPDR ETF fell by 4.18 tonnes to 1257.93 tonnes, the lowest since August 3, as investors booked profits. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that a vaccine for COVID-19 was given regulatory approval after less than two months of testing on humans, Reuters news agency reported. Health experts have warned about the rushed approach. Reuters reported that the World Health Organization and the Russian health authorities were discussing the process for possible WHO prequalification for the vaccine. Gold prices, however, found support is rising virus cases, increased US-China tensions and political wrangling over additional stimulus measures in the US. After days of upmove, gold has slipped and a drop below $2,000 led to extended losses. With the selloff, the momentum has weakened and we may see some extended losses if the key supports are breached. Comex silver was trading 8 percent lower at around $23.9/oz on August 12, a day after declining 11 percent. MCX silver slumped reflecting weakness in international market and weaker physical market demand. Weaker off-take in physical market also caused Indian silver price to trade at a steep discount to the international market, widening the spread between MCX September and December silver contracts. In the international market, silver came under severe pressure along with gold on a stronger dollar and Russia’s vaccine launch. ETF inflows, however, show that investors saw lower price as a buying opportunity. Silver holdings with iShares ETF rose by 66.6 tonnes to 17779.77 tonnes. Also supporting the price were signs of improvement in manufacturing in China and globally. Silver has rallied more than 60 percent since July, pushing it into overbought territory. We are now seeing some correction amid no fresh positive triggers to extend the upmove. We may see some extended losses unless gold rebounds sharply. NYMEX crude was trading in a narrow range of above $ 41 per barrel on August 12, a day after declining 0.8 percent. Crude oil continues to trade in a narrow range above $40 amid mixed cues. Supporting the price is the API weekly report, which noted a 4.401 million barrel decline in US crude oil stocks as against the expectation of a 2.9 million bbl decline. API also reported a bigger than expected decline in gasoline stocks and an unexpected fall in distillate stocks. Crude stocks at Cushing, the delivery terminal for NYMEX crude futures, rose for another week, highlighting increasing glut in the region. Forecast of lower crude production supported prices. US EIA has forecasted US 2020 crude production at 11.26 million barrels per day, down from previous estimates of 11.63 million bpd. EIA raised 2021 crude production estimate from 11.01 million bpd to 11.14 million bpd. However, weighing on crude is concerns about rising virus cases, increased US-China tensions and political wrangling over additional stimulus measures in US. The US DJIA index fell 0.4 percent on the previous day, snapping a seven-day winning streak. Growing US-China tensions days ahead of trade talks have made market players nervous. Also weighing on crude price is prospect of higher OPEC supply as the producer group is to reduce the pace of production cut from August. Crude may remain range bound ahead of the inventory report but general bias may be on the downside amid US-China concerns and rising virus cases. The focus will also be on OPEC’s monthly outlook, which will reflect on global demand supply situation. ",markets,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 02:48 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

At the consolidated level, the company reported Rs 1.9 crore as share in loss at subsidiaries/associates, down sharply from loss of Rs 21.4 crore in the previous quarter. Outlook For BFL, we expect 1%, 13.2%, 35% CAGR for consolidated sales, EBITDA, PAT, respectively, in FY20P-22E.

Revenue de-grew 87% YoY to Rs 738mn (vs est Rs 1.4bn). EBITDA turned negative to Rs 299mn (vs est Rs 115mn) due to negative operating leverage. Production in Q1 was equivalent to two weeks of regular working days. Management stated that the production is gradually ramping up and now back to 75% of pre-Covid levels. However, system inventory which was piled up due to lockdown to be liquidated in Q2. At present, Subros has Rs 2.4bn worth of inventory (vs normal inventory of Rs 1.9bn). Gross debt has increased to Rs 2.4bn as of Q1 end (vs Rs 1.12bn at the end of FY20), due to increase in short term debt. The management expects it to be back to FY20 levels by end of the year. Major capex has been incurred and the company is likely to incur a capex of Rs 500-600mn in FY21. We expect the company to be a key beneficiary of recovery in the PV segment and market share gain by MSIL owing to increasing preference for low-end entry-level cars. MSIL accounts for ~70% of revenue for Subros. Outlook Given the expected recovery in PV sales from Q2FY21 onwards, incremental revenue from new business verticals, reduction in interest cost, and benefit from the lower corporate tax rate, we estimate Subros to potentially report a PAT CAGR of 16% over FY20-FY23E.

Nifty has good support near a 200-day average, followed by the highest put OI at 11,000 strikes while on the higher side 11,500-11,550 will act as resistance.

The recent correction after the results is a good entry point to accumulate as the risk-reward is in favour and it has good support on the downside near its 200-day average. On the longer timeframe, the 21-month average will act as strong support and protect the downside from current levels. Canara Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 102.25 | Target price: Rs 125 | Stop loss: Rs 93 | Upside: 22% The prolonged rangebound move and crossover of the medium-term averages will witness a sharp up-move. It has formed a triple bottom in the range of Rs 96-98 on the weekly charts and the inside range, on the daily charts, should give a breakout.

Amid the pandemic, how important is financial independence for investors, and how best they can attain it? A) Financial independence is absolutely necessary to ensure that all our needs that are existing right now are getting serviced through a regular flow of income currently, and continue in our retirement days as well. So, to have necessary savings done in diversified modes shall ensure the regular flow of income in the latter stages of life to take care of all holistic needs and wants. The best way to go about the same is to carry on investing systematically with the right proportion of money in diversified instruments in order to have a regular flow of income through capital appreciation over a longer period of time. The 'right proportion of money' is the absolute amount of investments being done right now in lieu of generating regular cash flows in the future to carry on a similar lifestyle as well as account for inflation-adjusted returns and other mandatory outgoes like medical and insurance payments. Q) Your view on the RBI Monetary Policy announcement of August 7. A) More or less on expected lines in terms of holding up of rates. The other announcements in terms of liquidity support, expectations of transmission of rates trickling in the system, and data points which are expected to gradually improve, leave a window open for some easing in the next meet. The overall policy remains constructive and accommodative as far as the changes in the macroeconomic cycle and its associated dynamics are concerned. Q) Some new NFOs have been launched recently to tap US markets. Do you think that investing abroad is a must in one’s portfolio? What are the factors one should watch for before investing in overseas funds? A) It is a way to diversify the return expectations by diversifying one's risk across multiple geographies. In the current context, some areas of global equities can be outperformers assuming the business dynamics they are in and the moats they operate out of. One should however be aware that significant global macro changes or any disruptive macro changes for any particular economy can have an impact but that element of risk is what equity markets are fraught with. In today's context equities globally are more complexly intertwined and the entire decoupling argument is still debated. So, exposure partially can be undertaken based on one's risk/reward appetite. Q) Gold surpassed $2000/ounce just last week. Equity markets are also up by about 50 percent from the March lows, but will still beat Equity Asset Class hands down in 2020. Do you think investors should tweak their portfolio allocation strategy? A) Solid move by the precious metal; the two factors leading the price move were the fall in the dollar index along with the fall in the real yields globally. As the asset allocation and diversification strategy mandate some proportion of one's portfolio being in precious metals, a systematic investment can continue in the yellow metal. Q) Someone who is already invested or long in the market since March, what would you advise – book profits or hold for more potential gains? A) One needs to see in which sectors the exposure is to and what broad expectations are being laid out for the sectors as a whole. Sectors that have outperformed and where earnings have relatively held up have continued doing well. Clearly, one needs to have two broad perspectives; one, the sectors which are performing significantly better until the vaccine is found and the sectors which shall be in focus on the announcements of the vaccine. So the tale of two halves suggests defensive sectors are outperforming right now both on earnings delivery and management outlook but one needs to keep an eye on the economy-related, beta-correlated sectors for the second half which is beaten down and can start reacting hopefully, as some development on the vaccine front might come through in the next 1-2 quarters. Q) Which are you re-rating themes in markets and why? Or sectors which could get rerated as the economy normalises? A) The economy-correlated sectors which include autos, banks, NBFCs and capital goods players can be on the radar in the second half as the economy normalises, as the sector outlook related to demand and fixed cost absorption being better placed leading to earnings recovery estimations might work in their favour.

""Albeit technical picture on oscillator front continues to remain mixed fresh sell signals on lower time frame charts are being witnessed,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol. “Weakness will be confirmed on a close below 11,242 levels. Strength shall resume on a strong close, with a wide intraday trading range above 11322 levels. On such strength, a higher target towards 11450 can be expected, whereas break down below 11,242, can set the tone for a swift downswing with an eventual target placed around 10882 levels,” he said. Traders should wait for a breakout in either direction before initiating a trade. Also Read:  Gainers & Losers: 10 stocks that moved the most on August 13  We have collated views of experts on what investors should do on August 14 when the market resumes trading: Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director, Choice Broking Amid lack of clear direction, the Nifty fell more than 70 points after Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered his speech on transparent taxation to make an intra-day low. Mostly largecap shares were trading under pressure except for defense-related stocks that performed very well and may further give upside movement in an upcoming trading session. At current levels, the downside support comes at 11200 while upside resistance comes at 11450. Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments The Nifty index has become rangebound—between 11,250 and 11,350. It is a very narrow range and hence difficult to trade. I would advise a trade only if either side of the range is triggered. Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd      Markets have been hovering in a narrow range for the last four sessions and indications are in the favour of a further surge. However, a lot will depend upon the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing on the AGR case on August 14. We thus advise continuing with hedged trades, with the bias on the positive side. Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities A display of lack of strength of recent upmove and the positive sequential movement like higher tops and bottoms signal a possibility of minor downward correction from the highs (as per higher top formation at 11373). But, the Nifty is not showing any intention to weaken from the highs. Hence, there is one more possibility of new swing high formation in the short term (just above the recent high of 11,373) before a crucial profit-booking from the highs. Important resistance is placed at 11,400-11,500 level as per the weekly timeframe chart (as per change in polarity principle) and the Nifty not showing any significant downward correction from near this hurdle could be a positive sign for the bulls for an upside breakout of the hurdle. Hence, further movement in the market will signal any upside breakout. The short-term trend for the Nifty continues to be range-bound. The market is likely to move within 11,375-11,225 levels in the next session. ",stocks,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 09:49 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street for Thursday – the S&P BSE Sensex fell 59 points to 38,310 while the Nifty50 was down 8 points to 11300. Sectorally, selling pressure was seen in telecom, healthcare, banks, and energy stocks while some action was seen in capital goods, industrials, consumer durables, and metals stocks. The market seems to be moving in a range and experts advise investors to wait for a break above 11,375 while on the downside 11,250-11,225 will act as a support. Bharat Forge closed with gains of more than 15 percent on Thursday as brokerage firms raised their target price. Ashok Leyland closed with gains of more than 13 percent despite June quarter loss as investors cheered the opportunity in the defence space. Galaxy Surfactants was also buzzing in trade on Thursday as the stock hit its fresh 52-week high of Rs 1944.40. We have collated views of an expert on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on August 14: Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities Galaxy Surfactants: Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,725 should be the key levels to watch The stock has rallied over 16 percent so far in the month of August. On August 13, Galaxy Surfactants registered a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,949.50 and after a strong and volatile intraday session, the stock closed above Rs 1,800 resistance mark, which is broadly positive. The important thing is volume activity. The incremental volume activity post the breakout clearly indicates a high chance of further uptrend from current levels. On the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong promising price volume breakout formation that indicates bulls are clearly dominating the price action. Bharat Forge: For swing traders, Rs 460 should be trend decider level Post-200-Day SMA breakout confirmation, the stock has been soaring rapidly. The stock has rallied from Rs 400 to Rs 500 within a short period of time. That rally was price dominating and the volume activity has been modest. On the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a robust breakout continuation pattern which suggests that the uptrend momentum is likely to persist in the near future. However, on a short-term time frame, the momentum indicators indicate that the stock is in an overbought zone and the uptrend would be vulnerable if it closes below Rs 460 mark. For swing traders, Rs 460 should be the trend decider level. We can expect further uptrend up to Rs 540 as long as it trades above Rs 460 levels. However, a close below the said levels would push traders to exit out from their trading long positions. Ashok Leyland: Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips After a strong uptrend rally from Rs 42 to Rs 58, the stock was hovering between Rs 46.50 to Rs 53.50 price ranges. However, on Thursday, the stock not only surpassed its previous resistance of Rs 54 but comfortably managed to sustain above the same. The sharp 12 percent intraday price volume rally clearly suggests that the stock is into the strong hands and uptrend formation is likely to continue in the short run. In addition, on daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a higher low series formation followed by strong bullish candlestick patterns on daily and weekly charts, which supports further uptrend from current levels.

CLSA | Rating: Downgraded to sell from underperform | Target: Cut to Rs 19,000 from Rs 19,500 per share The company’s operating metrics continue to lag peers, while Q1 miss was largely driven by a lower gross margin.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-unlikely-to-cut-rates-in-2020-as-high-inflation-can-pressure-bond-yields-experts-5698761.html,RBI unlikely to cut rates in 2020 as high inflation can pressure bond yields: Experts,"India's  retail inflation  jumped to 6.93 percent in July as food and fuel prices picked up pace, the National Statistical Office (NSO) data released on August 13 shows, reducing chances of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The number was higher than that for June which, too, was revised upwards to 6.23 percent from 6.09 percent earlier. In the last two consecutive quarters (January-March of FY 2019-20 and April-June of FY 2020-21), the average consumer price index (CPI)-based inflation has breached 6 percent. The Reserve Bank of India has a target of keeping inflation at 4 percent within a band of +/- 2 percent. During its policy announcement earlier this month, the central bank said it expected the  headline inflation to remain elevated  in the second quarter of FY 2020-21, hence a rate cut was unlikely in 2020, experts said. ""Based on our inflation trajectory, we believe that room for further cut rates will not emerge until Q1 21 when we expect one more cut,"" Barclays said. At its August policy meeting, the RBI's monetary policy committee voted unanimously to  hold interest rates , citing high uncertainty and rising concerns over inflation. ""The statement emphasised the need to wait for a 'durable reduction' in inflation before easing rates further, establishing the primacy of inflation over growth,"" Barclays said. Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, also feels said till the consumer price index (CPI) hovered above 6 percent, the RBI would be hesitant on cutting repo rate, though with better monsoon and further easing of lockdown, inflation can be expected to come down to RBI's comfort levels. The RBI has cut repo rate by 115 bps to 4 percent since the lockdown, which has helped the bond yields to smoothen down. ""In July, bond yields were largely stable, this negative surprise in retail inflation will further create pressure on yields,"" Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer at Axis Securities said. Food and beverage prices, which contribute more than 50 percent of the CPI basket, rose to a four-month high of 8.7 percent in July, higher than 2.3 percent in the corresponding month of FY20 and 7.9 percent in June 2020. ""The inflationary pressure in this component can be ascribed to supply disruptions owing to localised lockdowns announced in states across the country in July,"" said CARE Ratings. Core inflation also scaled a 21-month high at 5.9 percent for July and this is the fourth consecutive month of pick-up, the rating agency added. Given the multiple supply-side price shocks and higher administrative costs, Barclays revised its CPI inflation outlook for the near term. It now expects inflation to average 5.3 percent YoY in FY20-21 against the earlier estimate of 4 percent. ""The upward revisions largely reflect higher food, fuel and gold prices, while underlying inflation is expected to remain benign, given economic weakness,"" it said. The research house sees the headline inflation staying above 6 percent through August and expects it to register a print lower than 6 percent next month. ""Inflation will likely fall below 4 percent by November, largely on the back of favourable base effects from 2019, when India experienced an onion price-related shock to food prices,"" it said. On account of a spike in coronavirus cases in the country, coupled with localised lockdowns, CARE said inflation would continue to remain at elevated levels over the next few months, but with some moderation.

As most positives seem to be discounted, the market will look for fresh cues to decide its path going forward, but experts don't see a major correction anytime soon. Falling volatility has also provided support to the D-Street. Ample liquidity from central banks across the world and record retail participation has kept the party going on the Street. Also, the solid response to fundraising plans of various companies hints that the rally may continue in the near-term, experts feel. The better-than-expected earnings in June quarter on the back of muted expectations, improvement in economic activities after the lifting of lockdown and several measures taken by government also lifted sentiment. The upside seen was not restricted to benchmark indices as the broader markets also saw a run-up in the same timeframe especially after consistent underperformance witnessed since 2018. Major sector-wise participation was seen in IT (up 62 percent), pharma (up 80 percent), metals (up 57 percent) and auto (up 68 percent) from March lows. ""We observe that 'value' has been the most dominant theme over the last three months which has beaten growth, quality and momentum. While value has outperformed we believe that the outperformance will not last as growth and quality are more likely to pick up as we have seen historically,"" Axis Securities said in its report which was prepared by Naveen Kulkarni. The brokerage also sees midcaps and smallcap performance slowly picking up. ""We believe that once the volatility index settles below 20 then midcaps and smallcaps are likely to see significant outperformance. We continue to believe that allocation to mid and smallcaps will result in decent returns over the next 12 months,"" said Axis Securities. India VIX, which measures the volatility, has consistently fallen for the last several weeks. It was around 20-21 levels at the time of writing this copy. ""Currently VIX is in the comfort zone, which indicates the market is less risky versus the levels it was trading three months back. During March 2020, VIX was trading in panic zone of 80 levels, which was earlier seen during the 2009 crisis,"" Axis said. Given the rally across sectors, experts feel the valuations are not at comfort levels except in banking & financials which has been hurting by the asset quality issues. ""Except for the BFSI sector, there is limited valuation comfort across sectors but the BFSI sector has balance sheet challenges. Nifty is currently trading at 18.7x FY22E earnings. While we are seeing broad-based improvement across the sectors the current valuations factor the improvement,"" said the brokerage. ""Valuing Nifty at 19x FY22E earnings we arrive at our December Nifty target of 11210 which provides limited upside potential, hence it will be critical to invest in quality midcaps and small caps to generate outperformance and absolute returns,"" it added. The brokerage has recommended 12 stocks in August which include ICICI Bank, ITC, Manappuram Finance, Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech, Mindtree, Varun Beverages, CCL Products, Aarti Drugs, Biocon, Minda Industries and Endurance Technologies. Axis Securities believes themes of digital, pharmaceuticals, rural plays, supply chains shifts, consumer staples and small ticket discretionary are long-term and maintained focus on stock selection. The brokerage added Aarti Drugs and Endurance Technologies to its top picks list. ""Aarti Drugs is a play on high growth API business and it is undervalued at current levels compared to its peers and thus offers decent upside from current levels. Endurance, on the other hand, is a play on the resilient two-wheeler industry which is likely to outperform the auto industry,"" it reasoned.

Spot Gold in the international market surged to record high level of near $2,073 per troy ounce last week, however, failure to breach past the next level of $2,100 led to some correction. Price slumped about 10 percent from the highs in a span of three days and hit a low of near $1,864 before moving back above the $1,900 level the same day. Gold rallied sharply in a short span of time from the start of July till early August and this pushed price deep into overbought territory making it vulnerable to profit-taking. Few factors which contributed to gold's decline were stability in the US dollar index after a slide to 2-year low, rebound in US bond yields after nearing record low levels, ETF outflows and signs of progress in vaccine development. While the sharp sell-off has dented market sentiment, the quick recovery from the lows highlights that market players are still seeing lower prices as a buying opportunity. Outlook for gold is still positive given the increasing challenges to the global economy. Global economic activity has picked up pace after the slump caused by virus-related restrictions, however, a continued rise in virus cases threatens to slow down the pace of recovery. Meanwhile, increased US-China tensions add to challenges for the global economy. The US and other major economies are also likely to continue with monetary and fiscal stimulus measures to boost economic activity. Gold's incessant rise called for a correction which happened and we may now see choppy trade continuing unless there are fresh triggers. We may see some consolidation near $1,900 level before the next move which could be on the upside. Gold's breakdown will increase debate about the possibility of such moves going ahead, however, we believe that more correction in gold may come only once the spread of the virus is contained or treatment for COVID-19 which is acknowledged universally comes. In the short-term, gold's price direction will be largely dependent on trend in US bond yields, US dollar and ETF flows. The rise in US bond yields seems to have taken a pause. The US dollar index has shown some signs of recovery after slumping to a 2-year low, however, we need a quick decision on the US fiscal stimulus package to push the US currency higher. ETF investors are highly price-sensitive so we may see no major activity unless gold resumes its upmove or breaks below the key $1,900 level.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/independence-day-advice-focus-on-businesses-least-hit-by-covid-these-5-sectors-are-a-good-investment-5702841.html,"Independence Day advice: Focus on businesses least hit by COVID, these 5 sectors are a good investment","Investors should follow the bottom-up approach and focus on businesses that have been less impacted by the coronvirus disruption, have a long-term growth potential and strong fundamentals, Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking, says in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar. Edited excerpts: Q: The RBI finally announced a one-time loan restructuring plan but with riders. What are your thoughts and will it solve banks’ NPA (non-performing assets) problem? We believe this move would alleviate immediate stress faced by banks and help them to navigate through this difficult time without putting much pressure on their asset quality. However, it will be early to comment on whether it will resolve their NPA problems as the extent of the crisis is still not known. Q: Following the mid-May rally, do you think the market is due for a major correction that can drag the Nifty to 10,000-mark or is it just consolidating to march towards 12,000? The rally has been largely driven by overwhelming liquidity, strong performance from the global counterparts and better-than-expected earnings announcements. Besides, the news of successive vaccine trails has also subsided the fear of a prolonged slowdown. On the flip side, though the economies (worldwide) are seeing healthy recovery, it remains below normal. Also, earnings outlook continues to remain uncertain. Moreover, on the valuation front as well, the benchmark indices are trading near record multiples. Amid mixed signals, we might see phases of intermediate correction in the benchmark but a possibility of sharp decline looks slim, considering the buoyancy in the global markets. In case of a major correction, the Nifty would find strong support around 10,500-10,650 zone. On the higher side, 11,600 and 11,800 levels would act as critical hurdles. Q: The broader markets still look strong. Do you think midcaps and smallcaps can beat the benchmarks this year, especially after underperforming them for two years? With the rally in the benchmark, the broader indices have also been witnessing noticeable traction for the last five months. And, we may see selective outperformance, thanks to valuation comfort, improving financials and healthy long term growth prospects. However, we would advise investors to be careful and follow a stock-specific approach as we have already seen a strong recovery from March lows. We recommend companies having prudent management, strong corporate governance, lower debt to equity ratio and sound balance sheet. Q: The IT index did not see major impact of lockdown. In fact, work from home helped IT companies in saving costs. Have you increased your exposure to IT and what is your pecking order? IT companies' financials are improving on the back of healthy order pipeline, robust deals, optimistic guidance from management and strong balance sheets. Going forward, the sector's growth would be driven by government initiatives for Digital India and support building the IT infrastructure for other sectors for business continuity and growth. Among the players, Infosys tops our list followed by TCS, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies. Infosys : It is one of the preferred picks in the sector as the company posted better earnings and its outlook is likely to improve on the back of robust deals, strong management, increased focus towards digitalisation and demand recovery. TCS : Q1FY21 was a muted quarter for the company, however, we believe that with its focus on core activity, emphasis on digitalisation (more online transaction and cloud technology), adoption and upgradation of technology and customer-centric approach will help the company bounce back in the coming quarters. Tech Mahindra : The company can face headwinds in the near term due to a decline in discretionary spend as well as delay in the execution of deals. Nevertheless, its medium to long-term growth scenario is likely to improve post H2FY21E led by a huge opportunity in 5G, strengthening of its digital business, tapping of new geographies and higher synergies in the telecom sector. We are positive on the stock for the investment horizon of at least one-two years. HCL Technologies : The company’s growth will be driven by the adoption of cloud and digital technology as well as focus on the core business. Further, the management, too, remains positive on a strong deal pipeline as well as winning large deals in the coming quarters, which will help revive its revenue and margin. Q: What is your advice to investors and traders on this Independence Day? We are advising investors to follow the 'bottom-up' approach and focus more on identifying businesses that are less impacted due to COVID-led disruption, have long-term growth potential and strong fundamentals. Based on these criteria, stocks from agri and allied sectors, pharma, FMCG, insurance and select private banking space are better positioned for investment. Q: Pharma is the leading sector in the current rally. Would you still want exposure to this sector? The pharma sector has been among the least impacted with the COVID-19 crisis as it witnessed incremental demand for products during the lockdown. Besides, it had been an underperforming counter for the last several years and was available at an attractive valuation. Thus the sector witnessed a sharp rally and mostly stocks are now either trading to their record high or reached closer to the 52-week high zone. Going forward, some correction cannot be ruled out at higher levels but investors should take this opportunity for buying, given healthy long-term growth prospects, strong product pipeline, robust financials and prudent management, which would continue to cheer investor sentiment. Also, there are high expectations of launching the COVID vaccine and demand for other medicines is also largely consistent. Q: The government has banned imports of 101 defence items to give a boost to Make in India programme. Are you a buyer of defence stocks and what is your advice to investors?

As we enter the 74th year of independence, India's growth story remains intact. Emerging from setbacks and fighting obstacles, we have earned the reputation of one of the emerging superpowers of the world. We have not only been able to maintain our socio-cultural diversity and democratic values unimpaired, but we have also made remarkable progress in many fields, including space technology, IT and pharma. India's stock market remains one of the most promising emerging markets of the world with tremendous growth potential as several structural reforms initiated by the Narendra Modi-led government assures that tomorrow belongs to India. The idea of a stronger India cannot take the shape of reality unless it is financially strong. While the country is gradually inching towards becoming an economic superpower, it is time for us too to make efforts for attaining financial freedom. Investing in stock markets is one of the best ways to be financially strong. Based on the views of several analysts, we bring you 11 stocks that can give you healthy returns in the long-term. Take a look: Analyst: Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President and Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 535.35 | One-year target price: Rs 710 | Upside: 33% The telecom sector is now a 2-3 player market with a good scope of ARPUs going up in the future. Management has guided for ARPUs to move to Rs 200 per month in the short term and Rs 300 per month in the medium-term (From current Rs 152 per month). Online streaming and demand for data are going to only rise from here in the future. Bharti has already provided for about Rs 47,000 crore towards ARG dues. ""The company should generate consolidated EBITDA of more than Rs 1 lakh crore in the next two years. It trades cheap at less than 7 times on FY22E EV/EBITDA,"" said the analyst. Axis Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 448.10 | One-year target price: Rs 600 | Upside: 34% After a slow loan growth of 6.6 percent in FY21, it should accelerate to nearly 13 percent in the next two years (i.e. FY22 & FY23), said the analyst. Net NPLs are at 4 year low of 1.2 percent. Although post moratorium NPLs will rise, the bank has been providing for potential COVID-related NPLs. ""While the near-term outlook is hazy for all banks, we believe a healthy asset mix, superior customer profile, liability strength and capital comfort will allow Axis Bank to ride this challenging period,"" said the analyst. ICICI Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 368.05 | One-year target price: Rs 470 | Upside: 28% The analyst believes that ICICI Bank has come into this crisis with much slower growth and less emphasis on market share. Net NPLs are at a six-year low of nearly 1.3 times with provision coverage ratio improving to nearly 79 percent. Share of retail loans has steadily increased over the years and account for nearly 64 percent of overall loans as at the end of Q1FY21. ""The bank trades at 1.8 times FY22E book value. For our price target of Rs 470, we value the bank at nearly 2 times book value and 15 times June 2022E EPS for lower RoEs in the medium-term,"" said the analyst. At the price target of Rs 470, the valuation of subsidiaries works to Rs 115 per share. This makes the standalone bank valuations very cheap on a P/BV basis. ITC | Buy | LTP: Rs 201.45 | One-year target price: Rs 260 | Upside: 29% The cigarette business is getting back to normal. Volume levels in June has dismissed concerns of behavioural changes in tobacco consumption due to extended lockdowns. Strong traction in the food and hygiene portfolio should help improve growth in FMCG. The hotel business is likely to have a slow recovery. FMCG business clocked more than Rs 1,000 crore in annualized EBITDA in Q1FY21. ""The stock continues to offer a good combination of (1) inexpensive valuations, (2) healthy dividend yield, (3) promise of solid long-term growth in FMCG and (4) emerging agri-business,"" said the analyst. SBI Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 861.50 | One-year target price: Rs 1,050 | Upside: 22% The annualised premium equivalent (APE) of the life insurance industry has grown at a CAGR of 14 percent in the last five years. If we take FY21 as the base, then the industry is likely to again report healthy double-digit CAGR for the next few years. For SBI Life, the analyst expects the value of new business (VNB) margins to expand to 19.5 percent in FY21E from 18.7 percent in FY20. He expects VNB margins to inch up to over 21 percent over the medium-term due to a steady increase in the share of protection business. VNB margin expansion will support operating RoEV (return on embedded value) at 16-17 percent in FY21-23E. ""We have a one year target of Rs 1,050. At the target price it will trade at 2.8 times embedded value (EV) on June 2022E,"" said the analyst. Analyst: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services HDFC Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,059.05 | One-year target price: Rs 1,403 | Upside: 32% HDFC Bank today is a household name in India and the largest in terms of market share in the private banking space. The bank, in the recent quarterly results, posted better top and bottom-line performance. Net interest income rose 18 percent year-on-year (YoY), backed by strong growth in loans and advances. While profits grew 20 percent despite a spike in provisions. Strong governance and equally strong asset quality have always been the hallmark of HDFC Bank setting it apart from its peers. Uncertainty with respect to CEO appointment is over and the bank is expected to build-up further on its growth momentum from current levels. ""We value the stock at 3.5 times FY22E BVPS (equivalent to the 3-year average forward P/BV multiple) with a revised target price of Rs 1,403,"" said the analyst. Reliance Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,122.05 | One-year target price: Rs 2,464 | Upside: 16% Focus on cost optimisation and integration to compensate the weak demand under O2C businesses, expansion of 4G network and upgrade to 5G technology, the launch of JioMart, the ramp-up of Ajio, and the start of oil production from R cluster in H2FY21 will boost the company’s performance in medium-term, said the analyst. Colgate-Palmolive (India) | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,434.35 | One-year target price: Rs 1,770 | Upside: 23% Revenues for the Q1FY21 quarter fell by 3.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) due to shrinkage of sales in discretionary categories like toothbrush and body wash whereas the sales volume in the toothpaste segment remained relatively stable. The company was able to increase its EBITDA margins by 190 bps YoY due to its cost savings in Advertisements and Promotions. Further, the company also increased its PAT by 17.2 percent YoY due to lower taxes and tax reversals from prior periods. Colgate remains debt-free and has strong cash flows to meet operational challenges going forward. With the launch of 'Colgate Ved Shakti' the analyst believes, the company will gain market share going forward as it will also cater to customers preferring natural toothpaste. UPL | Buy | LTP: Rs 489.15 | One-year target price: Rs 601 | Upside: 23% The analyst expects UPL’s net profit to grow at a CAGR of 26 percent over FY20-FY22E on the back of cost optimisation measures and an increase in volumes of value-added crop protection products. The entry into new geographies as well as synergy from the Arysta Acquisition will further propel UPL’s earnings into the medium to long-term. ""We expect a reduction in its debt-equity ratio from 1.3 to 1.0 over the next two years. We recommend a buy rating on the stock with price target of Rs 601 based on 12 times FY22E adjusted EPS,"" said the analyst. Analyst: Siddharth Sedani, Vice President- Equity Advisory, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers Escorts | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,120.85 | One-year target price: Rs 1,326 | Upside: 18% Despite the current challenges, we have seen a faster revival in the Escorts tractor business this quarter. Going ahead, the analyst believes its tractor business would grow in line with the industry, driven by strong rural demand across regions. Demand will continue to grow in FY22. Escorts expect the second half (H2) of FY21 to grow 12 percent YoY, leading to a 5 percent overall revenue growth. ""Assuming a favorable monsoon and a good rabi crop this year, we expect demand to continue and thus expect volume growth of 5 percent in FY21 and 12 percent in FY22, leading to a 9 percent revenue CAGR over FY20-22,"" said the analyst. HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: 599.75 | One-year target price: Rs 685 | Upside: 14% Owing to expectations of continued volatility in equity markets as well as a rise in demand for protection products, the company is set to raise Rs 600 crore which would provide 15 percent additional cushion. The management noted that business has gained momentum on a month‐on‐month basis and is seeing higher traction, particularly in the individual protection business. In terms of ULIP products, management expects demand to remains soft throughout the year. In addition, management stated that the company has been witnessing improving renewal premium collection trends. However, it remains cautious about the sustainability of these trends given the uncertain environment. The company remains focused on driving growth through its diverse channels of distribution – bancassurance, agency, direct, brokers, and others. The company’s digital assets have seen strong adoption across all its distribution channels during the quarter. Further, the company intends to tap new geographies and customer segments, enhance product offerings and bolster technology to improve overall operational efficiency and customer service.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/rethinking-internal-regulatory-architecture-5695801.html,Rethinking internal regulatory architecture,"Potent shifts in financial markets and entities have taken place and are still happening in an accelerated timeframe, thanks to unprecedented development in digital technologies. Yet, bigger changes are on the anvil, as many existing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality are sure to cross their tipping points, both on account of unleashing of  unlimited  computing power of quantum computers and the likely development of intuitive quantum algorithms. These developments are likely to make the present day regulators gasp for breath in the headwinds of change unless they prepare themselves with an appropriate internal architecture. There are many difficulties that regulators do face. Firstly, there is lack of domain knowledge. Much touted lateral recruitment has its own limitations. The domain expertise is outdated soon, loyalties are perceived to be suspect and each recruit has a narrow domain expertise while as a regulator she has to flit from domain to domain in the course of a day. Secondly, the flood of written material unleashed by photocopiers and soft copies. Reading through these is practically impossible. Technology as of date has only increased the workload exponentially. Thirdly, difficulties related to the staleness of data. The petabytes of data sitting in the data warehouses might be of great use to researchers. However it is of scant use to the person taking policy decisions. Reporting cycles are long and processing takes much time. Stale data is a poor guide to current reality and the regulator feels as if she were navigating in a deep fog. Fourthly, the difficulty regulators face related to severe limitation of sources of data. For example, detecting insider trading increasingly requires trawling through social media. Given the prolific content, searching for connections in virtual space turns into a hunt for the proverbial needle in the haystack. Establishing connections in the volume of financial data is important to central banks for understanding systemic risk. Finally, there is the problem of unknown-unknowns. Regulators don't know what to look for. Trends take time to emerge. There is no prize for guessing that there is a ‘single word’ solution for all these problems, technology. For lack of domain knowledge, there are expert systems. The answer to the flood of written material is Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining. For staleness of data, technology is already being used for pruning the gap between happening of events and their inclusion in the datasets e.g. the Billion Prices Project that seeks to glean prices directly from internet trading to calculate price indices. NLP and Image Processing can make social media tractable. The problems of divining interconnectedness is tackled very well by neural networks. The unknowns can become visible through techniques like clustering. Regulators have been investing in technology but they have been keeping it firmly in its place — the IT Department, a service department. The heart of the regulator lies with their liberal arts educated generalists, even as the entities they regulate have changed beyond recognition. A bank, today, is more of a fintech company. In securities markets, there is no doubt left that almost all players are basically technology companies, be it stock exchanges, depositories, registrar and transfer agents or brokers. At their core lies technology and the functions like sales, legal or compliance assume peripheral functions. The present day internal architecture of the regulators that treats IT as a service department to functions like registration, inspection and enforcement was designed to regulate traditional financial entities. Now that the regulated entities have turned into technology companies, regulators cannot afford to be so much behind the curve. Technology companies can be handled only by regulators who are essentially technology entities where other functions become peripheral.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the platform  'Transparent Taxation – Honoring the Honest' which provides for launch of faceless assessment and adoption of a taxpayer charter. Also the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which administers personal income tax and corporate tax, will launch faceless appeals beginning September 25, as part of the process to reduce physical interface between tax officers and taxpayers. ""Today is a landmark day in the history of tax administration,"" Sitharaman said, adding that the vision of the Prime Minister is to empower the taxpayers, to provide a transparent system and to honour the honest taxpayers. ""To realise this vision, the CBDT has given a framework and put in place a system in the form of this platform, a transparent efficient and accountable tax administration is what this platform brings in.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns-2/before-celebrating-the-import-embargo-on-military-items-worth-checking-the-results-of-the-defence-offsets-5696391.html,"Before celebrating the import embargo on military items, worth checking the results of the defence offsets","On  August 9, 2020, under the ambitious Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the defence ministry (MoD) announced the imposition of an import embargo on 101 military products with a declared intent on boosting national military-industrial capacity. This much-publicised announcement has been cheered by all stakeholders of the Indian defence sector, especially the private manufacturers. The embargo on imports will be effective in three phases: 69 items (from Water Jet Fast Attack Craft to Field Artillery Tractor (FAT) 6X6 for Medium Guns) by December 2020, 11 items (Wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) to Conventional Submarines) by December 2021 and the remaining 21 (40mm Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) to Long Range Land Attack Cruise Missiles) by December 2022. The includes low to medium technology items like Transportable Radar and Mini Trucks of different sizes to high technology items like Astra Mark I Beyond Visual Range Air to Air Missiles (BVRAAMs) and Communication Satellites. It includes both sub-systems as well as complete systems. The press release by the government lays out the larger intent of the Negative List: ‘……to assess current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing various ammunition/weapons/platforms/equipment within India’. It also outlines the lucrative domestic market size by announcing ‘…with the latest embargo, it is estimated that contracts worth almost Rs 4,00,000 crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next five to seven years’. The embargo is to be progressively implemented between 2020 and 2024, thus indicating that by late 2020s, Indian military industry should be ready to undertake further challenging military technology projects and be a part of the global military-industrial universe. Read the fine print Noble intents to re-energise the Indian military industry invariably appear lucrative, but once fine prints are understood, digested and ready to be implemented, such intents find themselves intricately lost in the world of military bureaucracy, complicated institutional dynamics and political apathy. Political or other blame games aside, the soldier is the final victim left to defend the country with whatever weapon he has at his disposal. Not to be pessimistic, but an interesting parallel announcement with similar intent had occurred earlier – the lucrative world of ‘defence offsets’ introduced in 2005 and implemented since then. It was designed to boost Indian military-industrial capacity. Various changes were made to the offsets policy from ‘direct’ to ‘indirect’ model, from project based to ‘offsets multipliers’ from time to time. Various estimates were made to show how the industry had benefited from this policy. However, as the saying goes – more things change, more they remain the same – not much progress has happened in the offsets universe in India, resulting in perpetuation of ‘muddle through’ syndrome in Indian military industry. This is not to say that all noble attempts are ill-directed. The latest Negative List prepared by the MoD is distinct from earlier attempts like offsets. The list is prepared and available for stakeholders with much clarity. It lays out an estimated market (Rs 4,00,000 crore) for domestic private players. It has taken a pragmatic approach by listing out those products, which incidentally many of the Indian private sector companies were already involved earlier, but as sub-suppliers or junior partners. The intent is to make them transit from sub-suppliers’ to ‘prime contractors’. Importantly, the government has also decided to bifurcate capital procurement budget for FY 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes. An indicative figure of Rs  52,000 crore (roughly translating into about 45 percent of the total capital budget) is earmarked for the private sector for this year. Oh! To be on the same page … It is rarely that public sector and private sector participants are on the same page, when a new policy or reform attempt is made by the government. Interestingly, all three employee unions of Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) have welcomed the list with a demand that production rights be given to OFB in identified items. It is not often known that the most pilloried of the public sector entities, it is the OFB that has least import component (13 percent against 40 – 60 percent for HAL) in its products. This is indicative of larger noble intents. Intents notwithstanding, it is the translation of ideas into tangible results that matter. In between lies the structure and institutional dynamics, which on many earlier occasions have diluted intents. The press release says, ‘all necessary steps would be taken to ensure that timelines for production of equipment as per the Negative Import List are met, which will include  a co-ordinated mechanism for hand holding of the industry by the Defence Services ",india,"Last Updated : Aug 13, 2020 02:46 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The sub-four metre model, based on Maruti Suzuki India's Vitara Brezza, will compete in a segment which has been witnessing robust sales growth despite a challenging business environment. Besides Vitara Brezza, the model would compete with the likes of Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon and upcoming products from Kia Motors and Nissan. The Urban Cruiser would endear itself to the discerning customers who are seeking more from a compact SUV, TKM said in a statement. The company will launch the compact SUV in its India line-up during the festive season to cater to the growing demand for compact SUVs in India, it added. ""With a customer-first approach, TKM has always endeavoured to fulfil the aspirations of its customers with timely introduction of new products and the Toyota Urban Cruiser is another such effort to satisfy the evolving customer needs,"" TKM Senior Vice President (Sales and Services) Naveen Soni said. The company hopes that the Urban Cruiser gives it an opportunity to welcome a new set of customers who not only aspire to own a Toyota SUV early in life, but would also like to experience Toyota's global standards of sales and after-sales services, he added.

The variant was originally dropped from the line-up a while ago and the sport variant was only available on the 330i. However, apart from a different engine, the car remains identical to the BMW 330i Sport. The 320d Sport is powered by a 2-litre 4-cylinder engine that produces 190 PS and 400 Nm of torque. Transmission comes via an 8-speed torque convertor automatic. BMW claims the 320d Sport gets a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 6.8 seconds. As mentioned before, the car is identical to the 330i Sport. However, there is one tiny difference. Where the petrol variant gets the M Sport steering wheel, the 320d misses it out.

The company said it identified ""an opportunity to improve the fitment of a 'brace nut' which is used in the wiper assembly of MY20 Jeep Compass vehicles"" during a regular vehicle quality audit process. The affected vehicles were all manufactured in 2020, the company said. ""The torque-induced brace nut should firmly clamp the wiper arm on to the wiper pivot assembly, enabling them to swivel as one unit when activated. A malfunction of the brace nut can result in the wipers not swivelling when activated by the wiper combi-switch behind the steering wheel,"" FCA India said in a statement. Increased tightening of the brace nut would improve its grip on the wiper pivot, ruling out the probability of a malfunction. This precautionary modification is necessary for consistent wiper function in the vehicle, the company said adding ""FCA India is unaware of any MY20 Jeep Compass customer reporting of a malfunction of this nature"". FCA India said it has commenced proactively informing affected MY20 Jeep Compass customers about this campaign and will be followed by its authorised workshops contacting customers to plan and implement an organised assessment and take necessary action.

The hiving off of the PV business will not reduce Tata Motors’ control over the business, a top company official said. The company has kick-started the process of hiving off the PV and electric vehicle (EV) business and placing it as a subsidiary, a process which could take a year to complete. Tata Motors has started talks with potential partners but has refused to share further details. Responding to a question from Moneycontrol, P B Balaji, Chief Financial Officer - Tata Motors said, “This (PV) is a business that we would want to run. We believe there is a long term potential in the business. The need for a partner is more from the point of view of accelerating the technology adoption and accelerating the product introduction roadmap. This is our business to run.” In March, the board of Tata Motors in-principle approved to hive off the PV business (including EV) by transferring relevant assets, intellectual properties and employees directly relatable to the PV business for it to be fully functional on a standalone basis through a slump sale. Though the spread of COVID-19 may have thrown a spanner in the works for Tata Motors, it is confident of completing the subsidiarisation process in less than a year. ""The board has approved the scheme for subsidiarisation and it will be filed with the NCLT in the coming weeks. We are expecting anywhere between 9-12 months for completing this process so it is a key priority for us in the coming months. We speak to a lot of OEMs and as and when we have something to share on that we will do it,” added Balaji. A move towards subsidiarisation of the PV business is the first step in securing strategic alliances that provides access to products, architectures, powertrains, new age technologies and capital. In simple terms this will unlock value for the company for the PV business unit which has been struggling in the face of strong competition. “The PV business will turn cash positive by FY23 and that will happen even without a partner that is the internal target we are working towards and we are confident of achieving that. Partnerships get us the momentum but that is not the base case,” added Balaji. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 01, 2020 09:33 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

While the schemes may look tempting, there is another side of the story worth telling. With rising cases of loans going bad, banks have become extra cautious when it comes to lending to the auto sector. We take a wider look at this in today’s automotive wrap of the week. But, here is a complete look at all that has made headlines in the auto space during the week. Tata Motors targets to be among top three Tata Motors intends to regain ground it ceded to rivals and  re-enter the league of top three carmakers in the country . But, that may be easier said than done, given how its market share has sunk to a new low. Tata Motors finished fourth in FY20 with a share of 4.98 percent of the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, as per data shared by the Society of India Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Thierry Bolloré to take charge at JLR Less than a year after being ousted from Renault, Thierry Bolloré - who was known to be close to former-CEO-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn -  will take charge as chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover . The development brings to an end Tata Motors’ six-month-long head-hunting exercise, which began after the announcement of current JLR CEO Ralf Speth’s retirement. Kia sales crosses 100,000 South Korean auto major Kia Motors on Friday said  it has crossed the 1-lakh cumulative sales milestone in India  within 11 months since it started selling vehicles here. The company entered the Indian market with the launch of its now-popular SUV Seltos in August 2019 and later on launched the multipurpose vehicle - Carnival. Demand recovers at Maruti Suzuki An increase in demand from first-time buyers and the gradual lifting of the lockdown have pushed demand for  Maruti Suzuki  cars to climb  to 90 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels forcing the company to start another shift  at its Gujarat plant. Strong uptick in retail sales which was nearly double than the wholesales in June has led to inventory levels of Maruti Suzuki coming down by the end of July. While domestic passenger vehicle wholesalers (company to dealer) stood at 51,300, its retails (dealer to consumer) stood at slightly over 90,000 units. Discounts make way for price hikes Bajaj Auto, TVS have increased prices over the last couple of months. Maruti Suzuki reduces discounts in July, compared to the June quarter. The automotive industry had recorded zero sales in April after the nationwide lockdown announced in March. Two of India’s biggest two-wheeler companies  Bajaj Auto  and  TVS Motor Company  , which control nearly 30 percent of the country’s motorcycle and scooter market, have raised prices over the last couple of months Banks tread with caution  Over the past two-three months the industry has been abuzz with news of auto companies tying up with banks and other financial institutions to get vehicle loans before more reachable to the car and motorcycle buyers. This included the roll out of a variety of schemes such as ‘buy now pay in 2021’ and ‘no EMI for 3 months’ aimed to entice the buyers. But with rising cases of loans going bad lenders have become more cautious than ever claim automakers. Shashank Srivastava, Head of Marketing & Sales, Maruti Suzuki India, said, “The interest rates have come down but not as much as we would have thought they would. The banks are relooking at the credit ratings of the consumer once again. They are reassessing the credit ratings of the consumers”. Not only do retail consumers need loans to buy the vehicles, dealers almost entirely depend on financing to support their business. With rising cases of dealerships being in stress due to the lockdown and being unable to repay the loans in time, banks have become extra cautious. “The process of giving loans to dealers for inventory has now become very strict,” said Shailesh Chandra, the head of passenger vehicles - Tata Motors. Dealers of other auto companies have also reported financing problems for particular vehicle segments. For instance the entry level bike segment which caters to the bottom pyramid buyers have seen reluctance from banks especially those with no previous credit record. Rakesh Sharma, Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Director, Bajaj Auto said, “The availability of cash in the hands of the entry level buyer is going to be severely impacted. I also feel that the financiers are going to make it difficult for them to get loans. They will be choosing the better customers in that segment. So certainly, the very much entry-level will get impacted more.” Then there is the three-wheeler segment, which like the commercial vehicle segment has suffered the brunt of the Covid-19 impact. In most markets local administrations continue to restrict free movement of three-wheelers used to ferry passengers. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 01, 2020 10:06 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Tube Investments of India Ltd will be issued 64.25 crore shares at Rs 8.56 apiece aggregating to Rs 550 crore, CG Power said in a regulatory filing. Also, TIIL will also invest Rs 150 crore in the company over the next 18 months in the form of buying warrants that can be converted into equity shares. The Rs 36,900-crore Murugappa Group, which also had an engineering arm, had made a non-binding offer to invest in CG Power. The board of CG Power at its meeting on Friday approved the investment, the filing said. The investment is, however, subject to TIIL being declared the winner of the Swiss challenge process to be undertaken by the lenders of CG Power by August 28. Under the Swiss challenge, other potential investors can make a counteroffer subject to the first investor (TIIL) have the right to match the counter offer. The investment is also subject to lenders accepting one-time settlement and restructuring of debt, the filing said. The Rs 550 crore investment will give TIIL about 51 percent equity stake in CG Power and this will rise as and when warrants are converted into equity. PTI had first reported the deal on July 1. Murugappa Group will be issued fresh equity shares and the money that it brings in would be used to meet operating and working capital expenditure. CG Power and Industrial Solutions, erstwhile known as Crompton Greaves, has an excellent order book as well as human and technical capital. It got derailed in August last year after a board-instituted investigation found major governance and financial lapses, including some assets being provided as collateral and money from loans siphoned off by ""identified company personnel, both current and past, including certain non-executive directors"". After the scam came to light, the company sacked founder Gautam Thapar as chairman, and a new board thereafter undertook cleaning up of the accounts and to fix governance issues. Processes have been overhauled and money siphoned off from the company is being sought to be recovered. The company is also talking to lenders led by SBI for the restructuring of Rs 2,200 crore of debt. In the regulatory filing, CG Power said TIIL will be issued ""64,25,23,365 equity shares of the company of face value of Rs 2 each at a price of Rs 8.56 (including premium) per equity share aggregating to Rs 550 crore."" Also, ""175,233,645 warrants, each carrying a right exercisable by the warrant holder to subscribe to one equity share per warrant within 18 months from allotment. The aggregate consideration for subscribing to equity shares upon exercise of the warrants is Rs 150 crore, of which Rs 37.50 crore constituting 25 percent of the aggregate consideration will be paid on warrant subscription by the prospective investor,"" it said. Post allotment of securities, ""Tube Investments will acquire control over the company and will have the right to appoint a majority of the directors on the board of the company,"" it said. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) as well as SEBI are probing former management of CG Power for lapses and fraud. Sources said the business performance of CG Power has been affected due to a severe crunch in working capital and bringing in an investor like Murugappa Group would help tide over that. Capital restructuring of the business and the company is critical as the working capital gap is wide and while the businesses are intrinsically strong, this starvation has led to lower revenue, they said adding the company has a robust order book of Rs 3,000 crore. The Murugappa Group has an engineering division which may hold synergies with CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd that designs, manufactures, and markets products related to power generation, transmission, and distribution. Chennai-based Murugappa Group is the holding company for a group of businesses. The Group holds diversified interests in abrasives, engineering, farm inputs, sugar, confectionery, plantations, bio-products, chemicals, nutraceuticals, insurance, and financial services.

This is a rare instance of a domestic company suing a multi-national company for trademark violation. The case is being heard by the Bombay High Court Justice BP Colabawalla who, in an interim order, has directed Walmart India to stop retailing the product in question till further order, The Economic Times  reported . Walmart’s drink is called ‘Fizzy Apple’. Parle Agro, in its petition, alleged that the retailer was “manufacturing, marketing, selling and promoting” the product “using identical font, style and colour scheme” as Parle’s Appy Fizz. Representing Parle Agro, advocate Hiren Kamod told the court the “mark, shape, colour scheme and label … the entire trade dress of the defendants impugned product is identical to the plaintiff’s product.” He added that these attempts show that it was “obvious” Walmart is trying to “sail as close to the wind as possible”. To support its allegations, Parle said it dominates the sparkling apple juice segment with over 90 percent market share, since Appy Fizz was launched in 2005. Kamod stated that the defendants are thus “seeking to ride the reputation and goodwill” generated by Parle’s product to make “wrongful gains.” On Walmart India’s part, advocate Abhishek Malhotra from TMT Law Practise told the court that ‘Fizzy’ was a common descriptive word which no one can claim monopoly over.

Spot gold has hit a fresh record high near USD 2,075/oz and is currently trading near USD 2,067/oz. In the domestic market, MCX gold October contract hit a high of Rs 56,079/10 gram on August 7, the highest price ever for a first month contract. Gold has continued to set new highs supported by persistent weakness in the US dollar, lower bond yields, strong investor interest and safe-haven buying amid rising virus cases, geopolitical tensions and increased US-China tensions. The US dollar index trades near 2-year low weighed by lower bond yields, mixed economic data, rising virus and political wrangling over additional stimulus measures. US weekly jobless claims data released yesterday was better than market expectations but contrasts with disappointing ADP jobs report released a day earlier. US policymakers have increased efforts to reach a deal ahead of a self-imposed weekend deadline but still lack consensus over terms of the deal. Gold holdings with SPDR ETF were unchanged on August 7 at 1267.96 tonnes, the highest level since February 2013, after sharp inflows in last few days. Global virus cases have continued to rise forcing countries to reimpose restrictions hampering economic activity and hopes of a quick recovery. BOE, at its monetary policy meeting yesterday, highlighted that it does not expect the UK economy to exceed its pre-coronavirus levels until the end of 2021. The US and China have been bickering over various issues and this has kept market players nervous about the trade deal. Gold has surged over 35 percent since start of the year however a large share of the rally has come in last few sessions. While there are spates of positive factors for gold, the concurrent rally in equity market, commodities, bonds and gold is a rare combination and highlights that the rally is more because of fund inflow in financial markets which is chasing all asset classes. Gold’s rally also remains unfazed by concerns about consumer demand due to record high prices. Gold’s momentum remains unfazed and it continues to be on path to the next benchmark of USD 2100/oz however some caution is warranted as we move close to weekend and key US non-farm payrolls data. COMEX Silver trades up by over 2.5 percent near USD 29/oz and hit a session high of USD 29.915/oz, the highest level since February 2013. MCX Silver September contract hit a high of Rs 76360/kg yesterday, the highest level ever for a first month contract. Silver trades higher supported by firmness in gold, recovery in industrial sector and strong investor inflows. Gold has surged to record high level shifting some buying interest in silver which has a strong positive correlation with gold and is much cheaper. Manufacturing activity across the globe is showing improvement which improves outlook for silver’s industrial demand. Silver holdings with iShares ETF rose by 57.93 tonnes yesterday to a fresh record high level of 17866.67 tonnes. The spot gold silver ratio is near 72 levels, the lowest since 2017, highlighting silver’s outperformance. Silver has risen almost over 60 percent so far this year however almost all of it has come in last three weeks. While positive factors persist they do not justify the sharp gains seen in such short span of time. So while the momentum is still positive, the rally is unlikely to sustain for long and market players need to be cautious. NYMEX crude trades moderately higher near USD 42/bbl after a 0.6 percent decline yesterday. Crude oil has turned choppy after testing the highest level since March earlier this week amid mixed cues. Crude remains supported by persistent weakness in US dollar and strength in US equity market and upbeat manufacturing data from major economies. US equity market rose for the fifth consecutive day supported by better than expected jobless claims data and efforts by policymakers to reach consensus on additional stimulus plan. The US dollar index trades near 2-year lows weighed down by lower bond yields and increasing concerns about health of US economy. However, weighing on crude price are demand concerns amid rising virus cases globally which has forced countries to take restrictive measures threatening the economic recovery. Increased US-China tensions has also kept worries high about the US-China trade under which China has committed to buy more US energy goods. Also weighing on crude price is mixed inventory report. US EIA report noted a sharp decline in US crude oil stocks but also an increase in gasoline and distillate stocks while crude stocks at Cushing, the delivery terminal for NYMEX crude futures, rose for the fifth consecutive week highlighting increasing glut in the region. OPEC supply is also expected to improve as producer group reduces its production cut starting August. Iraq however committed to make an additional cut in its oil production of about 400,000 barrels per day in August to compensate for its overproduction over the past period under the OPEC supply reduction pact, as reported by Reuters. Highlighting indecisiveness in the market, Saudi Aramco cut its September official selling prices to Asia by 30 cents a barrel from August and left its prices to the US unchanged from the previous month (Reuters). Crude may witness choppy trade amid mixed factors however we expect selling pressure to emerge at higher levels amid persisting demand worries and prospect of higher supply from US and OPEC.

ED also questioned Rhea's brother brother Showik, father and her manager among two others  in connection with its probe into the money-laundering aspects of the Bollywood actor’s Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide, which had happened on June 14. The agency grilled the four accused in the case over allegations that as a part of an alleged criminal conspiracy led by Rhea. They allegedly attempted to control Rajput’s life and finances, including bank accounts and credit cards, to their own financial advantage, agency sources said. A source close to the development told Moneycontrol, ""Rhea's father Indrajit Chakraborty and her brother Showik have been called again on August 10. It is yet to decide on calling Rhea again."" ED’s probe is based on a First Information Report (FIR) registered by Patna Police’s Rajiv Nagar police station, on a complaint by Rajput’s father Krishna Kishore Singh, wherein six persons including Chakraborty, a budding actress, are accused of criminal conspiracy, abetment to suicide, criminal breach of trust, theft and cheating. Apart from Chakraborty and Showik, her father Indrajit and her manager Shruti Modi also arrived at the ED office and were asked for information and clarifications related to the case by the agency, according to sources. The accused have denied any wrongdoing. According to sources, ED asked Chakraborty to submit her income tax returns filings from April 2015 to March 2020, which she would submit through her legal team. The agency also asked her for details on her assets in Mumbai. According to the sources, ""Rhea maintains the stand that she doesn't have much property. There is one property which was bought with a loan of around Rs 85 lakhs, of which Rs 60 lakh has been taken from a bank and one company, where Rajput was the director. The company paid up one lakh only. However, ED is investigating some property –related papers they had sought from the family. Chakraborty was also asked to furnish details on firms associated with her, which were owned by her or had she as a director/co-director."" ED is verifying the circumstances under which Rajput, Chakraborty and Showik came together for business activities wherein two firms, Vividrage Rhealityx Pvt Ltd and Front India For World Foundation, are under the scanner. In both the firms, Sushant was a director. While Rhea was a director in one of the two firms, Showik was a director in both the firms. The two firms are based at a common address, located at A 503, sector 8, Ulwe, Navi Mumbai, where an ED team has already paid a visit for preliminary enquiry. ED is also verifying allegations that the accused took control of Rajput’s credit card/s, bank account/s and a laptop, the sources said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/on-nagasaki-day-lets-not-forget-that-companies-gain-from-wars-5664231.html,"On Nagasaki Day, let’s not forget that companies gain from wars","Horror came to the Japanese city of Nagasaki on this day 75 years ago when Bockscar, the US Air Force’s modified B-29 bomber, dropped a nuclear bomb weighing about 10,300 pounds over the city. The bomb, named ‘Fat Man’, produced a 22-kiloton blast which instantly killed 40,000 people, a fifth of the total population of the port city. Most victims were burnt to death. Thousands more died in the following days and years with radiation poisoning and cancer the common causes. Just three days earlier, Enola Gay, another B-29 bomber, had similarly devastated thousands of lives in Hiroshima. Both bombers were modifications of those manufactured by the Boeing Corporation which is today one of the largest defence contractors in the world, and one among a handful of companies for whom war is lucrative business. They are a part of what has been notoriously dubbed the military-industrial complex. There is considerable debate about the rightness of the bombings of the two Japanese cities. Most Americans believed then that their country, which suffered the least damage of all the major combatants in the war, was justified in what it did. The Japanese obviously don’t agree. Rationally, nothing should justify the cruelty inflicted on the inhabitants of the city. What’s beyond doubt is that American industry gained enormously from World War II. It provided almost two-thirds of all the Allied military equipment produced during the war, including aircraft, artillery pieces, tanks and trucks. In the four years after it entered the war in 1941, American industrial production doubled in size, besides undergoing a metamorphosis as even non-defence companies such as Chrysler, General Motors and Ford turned to making war equipment. By the end of the war, more than half of all industrial production in the world was happening in the US. It has been a consistent trend since. In the 75 years since the war ended, the US military industry has gone from strength to strength, with the country’s civilian leaders playing a key role in this. Thus, in May 2017, when US President Donald Trump signed a record $350 billion deal with Saudi Arabia for military equipment, the gainers were companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon. Not surprisingly, the stock price of many of these companies goes up every time a potentate talks to White House. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, defence spending, according to consulting firm PwC, fell by about a third in real terms between 1989 and 1996. It was to be a false dawn. The military industrial complex wasn’t having any of it and while consolidating through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the biggest companies, worked behind the scenes to bring peace and prosperity back to the world. Soon enough normal order was restored as spending started going up again. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the total global military expenditure in 2019 at $1,917 billion was up 3.6 percent over 2018, the largest annual growth in spending since 2010. What’s terrible is that among the three largest spenders now are two countries, China and India, that till recently struggled to feed their populations. Sadly, data suggests that economic growth almost always leads to increased spending on the military, but not on education and health. The 2.4 percent of its GDP that India spends annually on its military budget goes largely to the big corporations across the globe. Even the order for 36 Raphael fighter jets, which raised a mighty cheer in the country, will ultimately shore up the finances of its French maker Dassault Aviation as it deals with the drying up of its business jets business.

While hearing the plea by telecom companies seeking permission for a staggered repayment of their AGR dues on July 20, the apex court had reserved its order in the matter. At the time, the court had also observed that there is no scope for any re-assessment or re-calculation of said dues, adding that the calculation given by the telecom department is to be treated as final. The SC had, in its previous hearing in the matter, asked RComm, Videocon and Aircel to submit all records and details of insolvency within seven days. It had said that it wanted to look into the bonafide of the decision to invoke insolvency on the part of several companies with AGR dues of over Rs 38,000 crore, that are currently in liquidation. The issue of companies under liquidation, however, will be considered by the court on August 19. In its October 24  order  last year, the SC upheld the definition of AGR calculation as stipulated by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). The government had suggested that the revenue from the non-core businesses should also be included in arriving at the annual AGR amount. A part of the AGR is paid by telecom companies as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer. As per DoT estimates, telecom companies owe a total of Rs 1.19 lakh crore with payments received so far at Rs 26,896 crore.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/drug-firms-race-to-launch-favipiravir-as-antiviral-gains-traction-in-mild-moderate-covid-19-treatment-5656091.html,Drug firms race to launch Favipiravir as antiviral gains traction in mild-moderate COVID-19 care,"Lakshmi*, 47, a homemaker in Hyderabad, was having intermittent cough, chest congestion and fever. Her RT-PCR test came positive for COVID-19. Her condition was diagnosed as mild-moderate, and the doctor treating her prescribed  Glenmark's  antiviral drug Fabiflu or Favipiravir. Within four days, Lakshmi's symptoms vanished, and a few days later she was tested negative. Glenmark's data from clinical trials involving 150 subjects showed that about 70 percent of the patients being treated with the drug achieved clinical cure by the fourth day of the study, compared with about 45 percent in the standard care group. Despite the company's encouraging data, many experts aren't convinced. They say that mild cases often resolve themselves without any treatment or with just standard care like paracetamol and multi-vitamin pills, and there is no need for costly treatment. But that's not stopping doctors from prescribing Favipiravir for COVID-19 patients. Dr. Rahul Pandit, Senior Intensive Care Specialist and Director of Critical Care Medicine & ICU at Fortis Hospital, Mulund says for mild disease Favipiravir can be recommended. ""There are two antivirals; Favipiravir and Remdesivir. The data on Remdesivir is better than Favipiravir. But there is a difference between these two drugs. Remdesivir is an injectable drug while Favipiravir is an oral medication,"" Pandit pointed out. ""Glenmark study was very small and the data was not very convincing to recommend it; however, when we don't have anything to use against COVID-19, Favipiravir did show that the viral clearance was definitely achieved. The mortality benefit is not significant in Favipiravir or Remdesivir, but that's not the endpoint. We only looked at viral clearance. Also, the ease of giving it orally makes it probably better acceptable than other drugs which are not antiviral agents,"" he added. Pandit is also a member of the Maharashtra COVID-19 task force. Doctors also take comfort that this is an old drug meant for the treatment of influenza.  Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral, was originally developed by Toyama Chemical Co, a subsidiary of Japanese drugmaker Fujifilm. The drug was approved in Japan in 2014. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, doctors in China and Russia have started using it to treat COVID-19 patients. The Drug Controller General of India in June approved the use of Glenmark's Favipiravir version for restricted emergency use in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. Rising demand But the increase in acceptance of the drug among doctors and rising COVID-19 cases are pushing pharma companies to boost Favipiravir production.  India has reported 1.96 million COVID-19 cases, and 40,699 deaths. In India, the cases are rising at a fast pace - more than 50,000 a day - with most cases coming from smaller towns and villages. Pharma companies that are quick to spot the trend have jumped into the race to launch Favipiravir. At least a dozen drugmakers including the big ones such as  Sun Pharma ,  Cipla ,  Lupin  and   Alkem  have launched generic versions of Favipiravir so far, and many more are in line to launch the drug.  Steep price drop The competition has led to a steep price drop. The price of the drug has declined by as much as 66 percent. Glenmark launched Favipiravir in late June at Rs 103 per tablet, but has slashed the price to Rs 75 per tablet last month. India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharma launched the cheapest Favipiravir at Rs 35 per tablet. A full course of Favipiravir for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 involves up to 122 tablets over two weeks. ""Favipiravir is fast replacing paracetamol as the standard of care for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and we are seeing huge demand,"" Prashanth Reddy, Director of Optimus, told Moneycontrol. Reddy says the feedback he is getting from doctors is that the drug is stopping the infection spreading to lungs, thereby reducing mortality. Optimus has approvals for both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and formulations. The company said it will be producing about 10 million tablets in August and next month, it is planning to increase supplies by 50 percent. The drug is here to stay for a while, said another senior executive of a large India pharmaceutical company that also has launched Favipiravir. ""We are seeing over 50,000 new cases daily; while the majority are asymptomatic cases, we assume at least 10,000 - 15,000 cases would be mild-to-moderate, eligible for Favipiravir,"" the executive said.

The implementing agency — National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRCL) — has its task cut out as land acquisition woes and estimates of cost escalation are proving to be a spanner in the works. In India, acquisition of land crops up as a major issue for infrastructure projects. So, how is the NHSRCL planning to deal with the issue? “Land acquisition is a lengthy and complicated process for any infrastructure project and we are no different. NHSRCL has been trying to convince project affected families to come forward and handover their land through a consent mechanism. We are also working with local communities in solving their day to day problems like providing health facilities, providing skill and entrepreneurship training to at least one member of the family through Income restoration plans. All these efforts are already giving us results and we are progressing well, as Joint measurement survey for the land required for the project is almost complete and more than 61 percent land has been acquired,” Sushma Gaur, NHRSCL spokesperson, told Moneycontrol. She said NHRSCL believes it has an important role to play in the development of the infrastructure sector in the country. Also Read | Bullet train project: Railways up against a stiff deadline, says expert   ""Infrastructure sector has the potential to boost economy, employment opportunities, develop skilled manpower and develop opportunities for local businesses.

NHRSCL will also prepare detailed project reports for seven new high speed rail corridors —  Delhi-Varanasi, Varanasi-Howrah, Mumbai-Nagpur, Delhi-Ahmedabad, Chennai-Mysore, Delhi-Amritsar, and Mumbai-Hyderabad. Speaking about these projects, NHRSCL believes India' chances of matching up to bigger economies can get a boost with the completion of Bullet Train project as it will not only put India at a higher pedestal of technology and connectivity, but also open doors for more foreign investment and development of new businesses.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/twitter-expressed-interest-in-buying-tiktoks-us-operations-say-sources-5667481.html,"Twitter expressed interest in buying TikTok's US operations, say sources","Twitter Inc has approached TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to express interest in acquiring the United States operations of the video-sharing app, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as experts raised doubts over Twitter's ability to put together financing for a potential deal. It is far from certain that Twitter would be able to outbid Microsoft Corp and complete such a transformative deal in the 45 days that U.S. President Donald Trump has given ByteDance to agree to a sale, the sources said on Saturday. The news of Twitter and TikTok being in preliminary talks and Microsoft still being seen as the front-runner in bidding for the app's U.S. operations was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Twitter has a market capitalization of close to $30 billion (23 billion pounds), almost as much as the valuation of TikTok's assets to be divested, and would need to raise additional capital to fund the deal, according to the sources. ""Twitter will have a hard time putting together enough financing to acquire even the U.S. operations of TikTok. It doesn't have enough borrowing capacity"", said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan. ""If it (Twitter) tries to put together an investor group, the terms will be tough. Twitter's own shareholders might prefer that management focus on its existing business"", he added. One of Twitter's shareholders, private equity firm Silver Lake, is interested in helping fund a potential deal, one of the sources added. Twitter has also privately made a case that its bid would face less regulatory scrutiny than Microsoft's, and will not face any pressure from China given that it is not active in that country, the sources said. TikTok, ByteDance and Twitter declined to comment. TikTok has come under fire from U.S. lawmakers over national security concerns surrounding data collection. Earlier this week, Trump unveiled bans on U.S. transactions with the China-based owners of messaging app WeChat and TikTok, escalating tensions between the two countries.

This would lead to more affordable COVID-19 vaccine. As part of the deal, Serum Institute has set a price ceiling of $3 (around Rs 225) per dose, made available to up to 92 countries included those under Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Read:  Serum Institute ties up with Gates Foundation, Gavi for 10 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses at Rs 225 each in India SII will produce vaccine candidates of AstraZeneca and Novavax, if they are successful in attaining full licensure and World Health Organization (WHO) pre-qualification. Gates Foundation, through its Strategic Investment Fund, will provide at-risk funding of $150 million to Gavi, which will be used to support SII for manufacturing the potential vaccine candidates. The funding will help Serum with much needed capital. The company is currently manufacturing vaccines at-risk. Serum's deal with Gavi provides encouragement for other Indian vaccine makers, who can commit capacities at much lower risks. So far, Indian vaccine makers' work on COVID-19 is through their own resources which is limited. The Centre is yet to make any pre-purchase commitments.

COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO, working in partnership with vaccine manufacturers from developed and developing countries.

The probability of success for a vaccine in early-stage development is less than 20 percent prior to phase-II clinical trials. a much broader array of vaccines than they would otherwise have through multiple bilateral agreements with individual manufacturers,"" Gavi said.

A Supreme Court bench comprising of Justices Arun Mishra, S Abdul Nazeer and MR Shah heard the case. However, there is still no clarity on the question of time period to be given to telcos for repayment of their respective AGR dues. While Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had sought 15 years' time for repayment of dues, the government had suggested a time-frame of 20 years. As Justice Arun Mishra is set to retire on September 3, an order on the staggered repayment time frame is likely before that. The SC had on July 20 reserved its order on permitting telecom companies to make staggered payments over 15 years. Also read:  Telecom stocks trade mixed ahead of SC's AGR hearing; Vodafone Idea gains, RCom down 4% SC observations: >> Justice Arun Mishra said ""We want to go into cause of initiation of insolvency for telcos under IBC.

It seems the govt will get nothing from the IBC process. What is the plan to recover Rs 31,000 crore from R.Comm? >> Government must come prepared with a plan for recovery of dues from telcos under insolvency. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to SC: >> Amount recoverable from Reliance Communications (RComm) is Rs 31,000 crore. Senior Advocate Shyam  Divan, RCom's resolution professional, to SC: >> Ericsson's claim was Rs 1,677 crore. Have submitted details as sought by the SC. Insolvency began on account of claims claims made by operational creditor Ericsson, China Development Bank. >> After banks failed to sell assets of RCom, the telco and lenders agreed for CIRP process to proceed. >> Resolution plan pending before NCLT, COC has given 100 percent approval. RCom owes Rs 49,054 crore to banks. RCom's primary asset is the spectrum, it can be sold or monetised under the IBC to realise value for banks. Senior Advocate Ravi Kadan appearing for Aircel to SC: >> Resolution plan has been approved by Committee of Creditors (CoC) and the NCLT. AGR dues are of Rs 12,389cr. After the takeover by the resolution applicant, assets can be sold to raise money. Spectrum is transferrable, can be sold and bought. No money is going to operational creditors, in compliance with the IBC. Insolvency process was initiated by the company itself in February 2018. Here's a quick recap of what happened at the previous hearing: The top court had in October 2019 upheld the expanded definition of AGR set by Department of Telecommunications (DoT). >>  Vodafone Idea  has to pay a balance of Rs 50,399 crore, while  Bharti Airtel 's outstanding amount is Rs 25,976 crore, said Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said on July 20. >> Both the telecom majors, which owe the maximum amounts, had on July 20 revised their demand from 20 years to 15 years for the staggered payments after Supreme Court's stringent stance on payment period. >> The SC is expected to stick to its observation that self-assessment of AGR-related dues by telecom companies is not allowed, and will uphold the DoT's estimates. Also read:  AGR case highlights | SC reserves order on time to be allowed for staggered repayment of AGR dues >> The SC had objected to any re-assessment or re-calculation of the outstanding amounts, and is unlikely to provide any relaxation in this regard on August 10.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-acing-the-online-job-interview-5668061.html,Coronavirus impact | Acing the online job interview,"Julie Weed The in-person job interview went away when offices emptied this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic. On the plus side, no more flying out to company headquarters and staying at a hotel, just to spend a day of meetings in an uncomfortable suit and then heading right back home. On the downside, common technical snafus and fewer body language clues can make the online process feel fraught. To successfully make the jump to team member from virtual job seeker, brush up on classic interview techniques and adapt them to the new world of internet interviews. Research the company and your interviewer Interview basics still apply, so start by learning about the company, delving deeply into its website, related news coverage and employee reviews like those on Glassdoor or Indeed. Know why you want to work there because you are sure to be asked. To research publicly traded companies, Amelia Ransom, senior director of engagement and diversity at the tax compliance software company Avalara, suggests delving into their online 10-K forms, which summarize annual performance, paying close attention to the key challenges a company is facing in the “Risks Factors” section. “Connect how hiring you can help them solve those challenges,” she said. Check out your interviewer’s LinkedIn profile, to understand his or her background and perhaps find things in common. Make sure that your own LinkedIn profile is up-to-date and that you’ve asked past managers to post a recommendation in case your interviewer is checking you out, too. Follow our LIVE Updates on the coronavirus pandemic here Set the scene For video interviews, make sure your lighting, camera angle, outfit and background all help you look polished. Best bets for lighting are sunshine from a window that’s facing you, a lamp bouncing light off a wall that reflects softly, computer screen clip-on lights or an inexpensive ring light. The New York Times Wirecutter site provides a video with more details. Place your computer’s camera at eye level or slightly above and tilted down (a stack of books underneath can help). Wear a professional-looking top that makes you feel confident. Virtual backgrounds can be tricky, so it’s best to find a clean uncluttered space, with nothing to distract the interviewer. Shut the door in case someone walks by. “Do the best with what you have,” Ransom said, “but don’t worry too much about it.” Recruiters understand the limitations of home-based interviews. “Don’t beat yourself up” if your child wanders by looking for a snack or the dog bursts in, she said. The interviewer is sitting at home “dealing with the same things.” Double-check the tech Technical difficulties are understandable, but do all you can to avoid them, said Eliot Kaplan, a former vice present of talent acquisition at Hearst Magazines who is now a career coach. Start by ensuring your Wi-Fi is as strong and reliable as possible. That might mean setting up your video call in the part of your home that gets the best reception, asking housemates to stay off the network during your interview or even paying for better Wi-Fi for a few months while you are job hunting. Make sure your laptop is fully charged. Keep your cellphone by your side (on “do not disturb”) with the interviewer’s phone number handy in case you need a backup communication method. Close other apps on your computer so you are not distracted by pop-ups. Double-check what will be in sight because video software programs differ in how they crop web camera views. Practice your answers and your presence Think ahead about common questions and how you will answer (without sounding too rehearsed). Behavioral questions are in vogue: asking for examples from your experience, like a time you overcame an obstacle, led a team or creatively solved a problem. It’s important to answer concisely and listen closely, especially on a phone interview because you can’t see the interviewer’s responses and other visual cues, said Karen Amatangelo-Block, a talent acquisition executive at a global hotel company and a private coach. “You’ll definitely lose them after five to seven minutes,” she said. Practice your posture as well, Amatangelo-Block said, because it’s important to communicate that you are engaged in the video conversation and excited about the opportunity. A tip she learned from newscasters is to “sit on the edge of your seat,” which helps you to sit up straight. Pull your shoulders back to convey confidence, she said. Even phone interviews should be conducted this way. “If you don’t think about your presence,” Amatangelo-Block said, “you’ll be more likely to start slouching, feel less engaged and be more likely to ramble.” Set up a video call with a friend to check on setting, posture and to practice questions. Convey your value Think of the three things about yourself that you can bring to the job that are not on your résumé, Ransom said, and communicate those. “Maybe you are going for an engineering job but are also a great public speaker.” As an interviewer, Ransom said, she wants to know the candidate beyond the résumé page and understand “their motivations and communication style, their personality. How will they expand the company culture?” Some of the qualities that companies have traditionally looked for — adaptability, flexibility, showing up as a self-starter and an independent worker — are more important than ever in a work-from-home world in which the boss isn’t around to see what you are doing, Kaplan said. One way to demonstrate those qualities in the interview is to talk about what you’ve done during the pandemic. “If you’ve used the extra time at home to pick up a new skill or take on extra work responsibilities to help out your team, let the recruiter know,” he said. If you relearned 10th-grade geometry to help your high schooler pass a math class, that’s impressive, too. Questions for the interviewer? Interviewers often conclude by asking “Do you have any questions for me?” Let your curiosity shine through and ask something that will help you decide if the position will be a good match for you, Ransom said. “Asking something like ‘Tell me how you got to where you are’ feels like a template question” and won’t help your decision-making process, she said. After you hang up Always send your interviewer a thank-you email and make it as specific as possible, mentioning a topic you discussed or something that inspired you. If you don’t have the interviewer’s contact information, send the email to your recruiter and ask her or him to pass it along. Each experience helps prepare you for the next Emily Chang, a recent graduate of Duke University, interviewed with 10 companies by phone or video before recently accepting an offer to work as a researcher for Rubius Therapeutics, a cell therapy biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She said she was nervous when she began interviewing and after each interview would “think of something that could have been done better and file it away for the next time.” Chang said signing into the interview web link 10 or 15 minutes in advance to make sure it was working, and to take some time to collect her thoughts, helped her avoid feeling rushed. She also placed a glass of water just off-camera and set up slips of paper she could glance down at with notes she had prepared, such as how her skills matched the job requirements. After being interrupted a few times, Chang started letting others in her household know when she would be interviewing so they would be quiet. Specifically, “I had to ask my dad not to play the piano,” she said. ",companies,"Last Updated : Aug 09, 2020 02:01 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The Maharatna firm had reduced its outstanding debt to Rs 13,949 crore as on March 31, 2020, from Rs 21,593 crore as on March 31, 2019, as it used revenue from better operations to retire some of the borrowings, according to the company's regulatory filings. Of the total debt, long-term borrowings account for Rs 2,245 crore which are due for maturity in December 2029. The firm's cash and cash equivalent (including other bank balances) rose to Rs 968 crore as on March 31, 2020, up from a record low of Rs 504 crore a year back. Standalone debt-equity ratio at the end of March 31, 2020, is only 0.07 which is considered comfortable. Company officials explained that ONGC has been working on bringing operational efficiencies and financial discipline and used surplus revenues to repay debt. ""While we ended the 2019-20 fiscal year with a comfortable financial position, we face an uphill challenge during the current 2020-21 financial year. The pandemic has played havoc on oil prices and government-mandated gas price is way below the cost of production,"" a senior official said. ONGC has planned a capex of over Rs 26,000 crore and meeting that with current oil and gas price will be a challenge, he said. Another official said the company had taken an impairment loss of Rs 4,899 crore in Q4 FY'20 to factor into estimated future crude oil and natural gas prices. However, the company believes that oil and gas prices will recover in future, and in that case, this impairment loss shall be reversed as and when prices rise.

Recently, the Khaitan family had also indicated that they were ready to jointly manage the company, which is listed on stock exchanges. ""We are ready to evaluate options for any additional share purchase. But, we will keep our holding below 25 percent,"" Mohit Burman told PTI on Sunday. Burman is a senior member of the Burman family, also the promoters of the Dabur group. Under Sebi norms, if the stake of an existing shareholder in a listed company goes beyond 25 percent, then that shareholder would be required to make an open offer. When asked whether the family would be interested in jointly managing the company with the Khaitan family, Burman said it was too early to talk about such a scenario. At the end of June, the Khaitan family had around 22.16 percent stake in Eveready Industries. Since then, IL&FS and IndusInd Bank have invoked shares of the company pledged by the Khaitan family.

The company, which reported a consolidated net loss of 19.66 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2020, said its manufacturing and supply chain operations are fully operational. Blue Star had posted a net profit of Rs 76.84 crore in the April-June quarter a year ago. ""We have cut the operating costs in line with the potential revenue loss and infused capital through long-term debt to strengthen the resilience of our balance sheet. We will continue to prioritise project execution based on cash flow,” Blue Star said in an investors' update. The room air conditioners and commercial refrigeration businesses are expected to gain traction gradually and expectation is that the market will get back to normal by Q4FY21, it said. The company said healthcare, pharma and processed foods segments will continue to offer good opportunities for the commercial refrigeration business in the new normal. ""We will endeavour to overcome this challenging phase in a balanced and agile manner with focus on prudent management of working capital and operating costs, while ramping up revenue,"" the company added. During the first quarter of the current fiscal, Blue Star's revenue from unitary products -- room air conditioner, commercial refrigeration and water purifier business -- was at Rs 274.85 crore as compared to Rs 906.89 crore in the first quarter of 2019-20, a decline of 69.7 per cent. ""Inability to sell during a substantial part of the peak selling summer season combined with additional burden of demurrage and detention charges due to the lockdown resulted in erosion of margins,"" the company said. Blue Star said, for the room air conditioner business, it estimates that the market shrunk by almost 65 per cent during the quarter with the conventional retail outlets and non-essential e-commerce sales shut till the third week of May due the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Following the strategic completion of pre-engineering activities for the project beforehand, ground breaking has begun on zero date itself, a BHEL statement said. This is a major achievement as conventionally it takes a few months after the zero date to initiate civil works on-site, the company said. Valued at approximately Rs 3,500 crore, the turnkey order for Sagardighi Thermal Power Project Extension Unit-5 was won by BHEL against stiff international competitive bidding. The order for the project located at Manigram village in Murshidabad district of West Bengal was placed on BHEL by West Bengal Power Development Corporation (WBPDCL). The notice to proceed was issued after obtaining the necessary approvals like environmental clearances. BHEL's scope of work in the project includes design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection, testing and commissioning of the main plant turnkey package, the statement said. The package comprises supercritical boiler and turbine generator along with its auxiliaries, electricals, controls and instrumentation, switchyard, flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, coal handling plant and ash handling plant. The key equipment for the project will be manufactured at BHEL's Trichy, Haridwar, Bhopal, Ranipet, Hyderabad, Jhansi, Thirumayam and Bengaluru plants, while the company's Power Sector - Eastern Region division will be responsible for construction and installation activities on site. The Sagardighi thermal power station is already equipped with two sets of 500 MW installed by BHEL in 2016. BHEL has so far contributed over 80 per cent of the total coal-based generating capacity of WBPDCL. In addition to Sagardighi, BHEL has executed projects at Bakreswar (5x210 MW), Kolaghat TPS (6x210 MW), Bandel TPS (1x210 MW) and Santaldih TPS (4x120 MW + 2x250 MW) for WBPDCL. The BHEL-installed units are running successfully and form the backbone of electricity generation in the state of West Bengal. BHEL is India's largest manufacturer of power generation equipment with an installed base of over 1,90,000 MW of power plant equipment globally.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/trumps-buy-american-order-for-essential-drugs-may-have-limited-impact-on-indian-pharma-companies-5659291.html,Trump's 'Buy American' order for essential drugs may have limited impact on Indian pharma companies,"The Covid-19 pandemic and tensions with China have trained the spotlight on the US’s heavy reliance on imports for generic drugs. In an effort to end this dependence, US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order directing federal agencies to buy certain essential medicines solely from US factories. Trump's order does not mention the specific names of the drugs; instead it directs the USFDA to decide on the list based on new requirements. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro explained that government agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs can opt out of buying American drugs if the product is not produced in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities in the US or buying the product locally would raise procurement costs by 25 percent. The latest order, called ‘Buy American’, comes less than two weeks after the US government’s drug pricing executive orders, in which it proposed the creation of an international pricing index that will seek to cap pricing of drugs under Medicare Part-B to the lowest price available in economically comparable countries. That move could impact Indian companies adversely. What’s behind the ‘Buy American’ order? Over 90 percent of US prescriptions are generic medicines, and their supply chain is directly or indirectly linked to China and India. Concerns have been raised by US Congress members across the political divide about the country’s reliance on China for drugs, which was seen as a threat to national security during public health emergencies. The US government's $765 million loan to Eastman Kodak, which once made cameras and films, to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients of generic drugs is also being seen as an attempt to cut down on imports. The ‘Buy American’ order also proposes to provide some relaxations to US manufacturers on USFDA and Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Impact on Indian drug companies The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, the main lobby representing large Indian drug makers, said it is keenly watching the developments, as the US is a key market for pharmaceutical exports. “We are studying the executive order, so we can't comment at the moment,” said Sudarshan Jain, Secretary General of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. India exported drugs worth about $6.7 billion in FY20, which constitutes about one-third of the country’s pharmaceutical exports. Uday Bhaskar, Director General, Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil), a trade body under the Ministry of Commerce, said the impact of the executive order would be limited. “Out of the US generics market of $65-$70 billion, India's contribution is only about 10 percent, and India’s cost of production is 40 percent lower than North America and Europe. The US market has become highly price sensitive for generic drugs,” Bhaskar said. Other industry sources echoed Bhaskar, saying it would be challenging for the US government to bring a significant chunk of generic manufacturing to its shores, due to significant difference in cost overheads compared to India. The measures are targeted mainly at China due to the ongoing US-China hostilities and may even benefit India strategically, sources told Moneycontrol, pointing out that China is almost the only source globally for fermentation based API, and the order targets such procurement. In fact, development of APIs and critical medicine manufacturing in the US may be a strategic positive for India, in terms of national security considerations, and providing non-China sources, one source said.

There is a full blown review as well and you can read that  here . But here are some pics of Hero’s new premium 160cc bike. The Hero Xtreme 160R gets fairly aggressive styling with a broad tank and a step up seat that appears to be short and stubby. The headlamp of the bike looks like it has been taken straight out of a Transformers movie and features all LED lighting and DRLs. At the rear, too, the tail lamp features a smoked screen so when the bike isn’t functioning, the lamp melds into the rear becoming almost invisible. Powering the Xtreme is a 163cc fuel injected single-cylinder that can churn out 15 PS at 8,500 rpm and 14 Nm at 6,500 rpm. Transmission is handled by a 5-speed constant mesh gearbox. The output figures may not be best in class but with 138.5 kg at the kerb on the single disc variant, those numbers make a lot of difference. Other cycle parts include conventional telescopic forks up front and a rear monoshock and 17 inch alloys that are stopped by a disc at the front and a either a drum or a disc at the back.

Wholesale (company to dealers) volumes of four of India’s top five passenger vehicle (PV) makers recorded a jump of 80 percent in July to 152,379 units as against 84,535 units sold in June. The sequential comparison is made because many dealerships are still nonoperational due to the COVID-19 disruption. When compared to July of last year the four PV makers, who control more than 70 percent of India’s car and SUV market, clocked a 6 percent drop in volumes. Manufacturers consider this as a faster than expected recovery as it comes on the back of zero sales in April. Maruti Suzuki , India’s largest carmaker, saw its wholesale volumes of domestic PVs nearly double to 97,768 units during July compared to June. The Delhi-based maker of Baleno and Swift still bettered its July sales of last year recording a growth of 1.3 percent. The company’s most affordable category made up of Alto and S-Presso saw 49 percent jump in volumes in July compared to July 2019. In a recent analyst conference call Maruti’s senior executives stated that there is a strong demand for small hatchbacks and the trend is expected to continue. Korean car brand Hyundai recorded wholesale volume jump of nearly 80 percent in July to 38,200 units as against June on the back of strong demand for the Creta SUV which has garnered over 55,000 bookings since launch. When compared to July of last year Hyundai recorded a fall of 2 percent. SUV-specialist  Mahindra & Mahindra  sold 11,025 passenger vehicles to its dealers during July which was an increase of 37 percent compared to June. When compared to July of 2019 M&M recorded a decline of 35 percent. In a media statement Veejay Nakra, Chief Executive Officer, Automotive Division, M&M said, “We are happy to see a growing trend in our overall vehicle sales, buoyed by the continuing revival in demand, primarily in rural and semi urban India. It is encouraging to see that the enquiry and booking levels in July are significantly higher compared to June.” Japanese car brand Toyota sold 5,386 units to its dealers during July, a growth of 39 percent compared to June. But when compared to July 2019 Toyota recorded a fall of 48 percent in volumes. Naveen Soni, Sr Vice President, Sales & Service, Toyota Kirloskar said, “Despite various challenges, the month of July witnessed better sales in terms of both retail and wholesales when compared to June. The first month of unlock (June) witnessed demand rekindling and retails being very good due to several factors including  pending customer orders as well as pent up demand accumulated as a result of the extended lockdown.” ",,"Last Updated : Aug 01, 2020 06:08 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

In the three months until June 30, Britain's luxury carmaker said the UK market was particularly impacted by the pandemic with sales down 69.5 percent. However, it said that sales improved month-by-month within the quarter across all regions as economies re-opened, with June retails down 24.9 percent, highlighting a recovery in China and North America as “particularly encouraging”. “Jaguar Land Rover has reacted with resilience and agility to the extraordinary challenges faced in the first three months of the new fiscal year, adapting rapidly to the widespread macro-economic disruption and uncertainty facing our industry,” said Dr Ralf Speth, the outgoing CEO of JLR. “Through this unprecedented time, we have continued to bring outstanding new vehicles to market, electrifying our multi-award-winning range and building demand for the new Land Rover Defender, an icon reimagined for the digital age,"" he said. ""As the lockdowns ease, we will emerge from the pandemic with our most advanced product line-up yet, and with the financial and operating measures in place to return to long-term sustainable profit,” he said. The company said that about 98 percent of its retailers worldwide are now fully or partially open and all JLR plants have resumed production, with the exception of the Castle Bromwich facility in the West Midlands region of England, which will gradually restart from August 10. “All locations are operating with robust protocols and guidelines to ensure effective social distancing, hygiene and health monitoring, whilst still enabling production to increase in line with recovering demand,” JLR said. For the first three months of the 2020-21 fiscal year, revenue was 2.9 billion pounds in the quarter. The Chery Jaguar Land Rover Joint Venture in China achieved break-even profits in the quarter. Free cash flow was negative 1.5 billion pounds including a one-time working capital outflow of 1.1 billion pounds resulting from the plant shutdowns, which is about 500 million pounds better than previous guidance, the company said. It added that despite the significant impact of COVID-19, the company successfully completed 647 million pounds of new funding and ended the quarter with “solid liquidity” of 4.7 billion pounds, including 2.75 billion pounds of cash and short-term investments and a 1.9 billion pounds undrawn revolving credit facility. “The fundamental strengths of Jaguar Land Rover have been tested in 2020 and we will pass this test to succeed in the future. Our exciting pipeline of new, advanced products places us at the forefront of our industry,” added Speth, who will be succeeded by Thierry Bolloré as CEO next month. “We have a clear plan, a highly-skilled, creative team and unparalleled technical capabilities. I look forward to working with my successor Thierry Bolloré as Jaguar Land Rover focuses on its Destination Zero mission, and seeks to deliver the autonomous, connected, electric and shared experiences that our customers will love, for life with integrity,” said Speth, who will assume the role of non-executive vice-chairman of JLR. The carmaker part of the Tata Group said that sales of its New Land Rover Defender have started to ramp up in the quarter in the UK, Europe, North America, and some overseas markets, with sales beginning in China and other markets from July onwards. Plug-in hybrid and the recently-announced Hard Top commercial derivatives will be available later in the year. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 01, 2020 06:14 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The company also believes that while vehicle sales have improved in July, the outlook for festive season will depend on how the health crisis pans out, and the long-term vehicle demand will also depend a lot on the fundamentals of the economy. ""First-time car buying is up and replacement buying is down, which means exchange is down. However, additional car buying is also up because of the functionality requirement,"" Maruti Suzuki India Ltd Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava told PTI. Explaining reasons behind the development, he said, ""That means people are preferring personal transport over public transport. At the same time their income levels are also probably going to be suppressed for sometime. Therefore, the trend is towards what we call 'telescoping of demand downwards', that is logical and intuitive. It is also reflecting in the data which we have so far."" The company had witnessed the share of first-time buyers going up by 5.5 per cent to around 51-53 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019-20. MSI has also seen enquiry levels reach 85-90 per cent of pre-COVID levels with higher share in mini and compact segments at around 65 per cent against around 55 per cent earlier. In July, sales of MSI's mini segment cars comprising Alto and S-Presso grew by 49.1 per cent at 17,258 units as against 11,577 units in the same month last year but that of compact segment consisting of models like WagonR, Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire was down 10.4 per cent at 51,529 units as against 57,512 units in the year-ago month. The company's overall domestic passenger vehicle sales in July grew by 1.3 per cent at 97,768 units as compared to 96,478 units in July 2019. When asked if July sales data indicate recovery in the automobile market, Srivastava said, ""There is relief and optimism based on July numbers...It does indicate restoration of normalcy in terms of production, supply chain and that is the defining characteristic of July (sales)."" Srivastava, however, cautioned that the July numbers were over a low base of last year ""which is way off the high levels we have seen in the past"". ""Going forward we have to carefully watch. Long-term demand will depend on the fundamentals of the economy. Also, it will depend on which way this 'Covid sentiment' moves, that is a very uncertain thing. We have to also closely watch the local lockdown because it does disrupt the momentum of retails at both the dealer end as well as the consumer end,"" he said. The localised lockdowns have also had an impact on the functioning of the company's retail outlets, he added. ""We have 3,080 outlets, out of which at one point of time we had more than 2,800 functioning. Then local lockdown started and it keeps on varying because at different places sometime lockdown is for one week, sometimes for five days,"" he said, adding at present the total number of the company's outlets that are open is varying between 81-91 per cent of total outlets. On festive season outlook, he said, ""Since it is a discretionary purchase it will depend a lot on how sentiments are. In festival times car buying generally increases because consumers have a bigger intention or inclination to spend money but sentiment this time is little unprecedented.""

The company recently introduced automated manual transmission (AMT) trims for entry level Kwid and new entrant Triber, in addition to the manual transmission variants. The company is now gearing up to further bolster its product portfolio. ""We will soon launch Duster with an all-new turbo engine (petrol), making it the most powerful SUV in its segment,"" Renault India Operations Country Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Venkatram Mamillapalle told PTI in an interview. Furthermore, the company is readying an all-new product for India market, he added. ""True to our product strategy, Renault's new offering will be a disruptor that will cater to the evolving customer expectations, while establishing the expertise of India's design, technical and manufacturing prowess on the global map,"" Mamillapalle noted. India is one of the key markets for Groupe Renault and has been part of the top ten global markets on a cumulative sales basis for the last few years. ""We have some of the most popular global products in our portfolio, led by Kwid, which is one of the top cars for the group globally,"" he added. Having introduced Triber recently and with Kwid still receiving a robust response, Renault saw its sales surge 75.5 per cent in July to 6,422 units as compared with 3,660 units in July 2019. Robust response to AMT versions of Kwid and Triber have also helped the company shore up additional volumes. Elaborating on the company's mid-to-long term strategic plan to strengthen rural markets for growth, Mamillapalle said last year the company initiated an activity which targeted 330 rural towns across the country. ""This is a new avenue that we are aggressively pursuing with an innovative and comprehensive strategy. We have also initiated a special project - VISTAAR to amplify and grow our presence in rural India and our dealership teams have recruited specialised sales consultants to reach out to rural markets,"" he added. The share of rural markets in Renault India's total sales grew to 25 per cent in April-June quarter from 19 per cent in January-March period. This has been achieved through strong product acceptance and focused efforts invested across the rural markets, Mamillapalle said. Commenting on initiatives taken by the company to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said that besides launching several initiatives for contactless sales and service, the company also supported its dealers in many ways. ""We announced incentives and relaxation on targets to ease the effects of the lockdown, and set up a task force to facilitate financial transactions with the dealership networks. We also supported our dealer partners in terms of inventory holding costs,"" Mamillapalle said. At the same time, the company also started a special program for skill development and online training of network sales teams, he added. On businesss outlook for current fiscal, Mamillapalle noted, ""We look at 2020 and the mid-term with cautious optimism and hope.

The team has subsequently announced fresh sponsorship deals, including one with former partner Gulf Oil, with Brown saying more were in the pipeline. ""I think we're in quite a good position now,"" said the American, whose team went into Sunday's fourth round of the season in third place in the constructors' championship. ""The bad news is behind us, as far as it relates to all the stuff that played out the last couple of months. We're financially healthy.

There are changes all around on the new Fireblade ranging from design aesthetics to the engine. Starting with design however, the bike draws inspiration from the company’s MotoGP bike, the RC213V. The additional R however, symbolises the addition of winglets to aid in aerodynamics, just like the ones on the Ducati Panigale V4 R and Kawasaki H2 R. Overall, the bike is more compact now along with smaller, sharper headlights and a fuel tank that sits 45mm lower for a better tuck in position. The engine on the other hand is based on the Honda’s road-going RC213V-S. The new inline-four makes 217.5 PS at 14,500 rpm and 113 Nm at 12,500 rpm.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/as-repeated-lockdowns-disrupt-production-automakers-ask-parts-suppliers-to-pile-up-stocks-5636351.html,"As repeated lockdowns disrupt production, automakers ask parts suppliers to pile up stocks","With the market showing early signs of a turnaround, as evident from their  stellar performance in July , automakers are asking their parts suppliers to produce as much as they can and stock up in order to avoid any further disruptions in output. Any unevenness in quality or total lack of availability of even a single component can derail the entire production schedule at a vehicle-maker’s factories. Several automakers have therefore asked their parts vendors to step up supplies to ensure smooth production cycles. Speaking to analysts last week, Rahul Bharti, Senior VP, Corporate Planning and Government Affairs at  Maruti Suzuki  India, said: “We have to be mindful about local lockdowns across cities or States of different kinds. Our vendors are located in about 46 districts over 9 states and sometimes they witness these lockdowns.” “So our strategy is, wherever the vendor is, at whichever point of time he is, let him keep producing to the maximum and keep stocking. We never know when the lockdown will hit him. So, at least the stocks and inventories will help during such lockdowns”, Bharti said. Struggling to meet targets While social distancing norms have resulted in reducing the number of workers inside factories, the unavailability of components was one of the other reasons demand outstripped supply in July as vehicle manufacturers were seen struggling to meet targets. Speaking to analysts last week, P B Balaji, Chief Financial Officer,  Tata Motors , said: “We continue to be impacted by the supply situation because of the intermittent lockdowns in various parts of the country. Therefore this is going to be a challenge for us to address in this particular quarter — to get this under control so that the supply chain moves in a more rhythmic manner compared to the stop- start mode that we are currently working in.” Suppliers hit by financial challenges Parts suppliers, especially those in the third rung, faced financial challenges to the extent of  getting wiped out completely during the lockdown . This highly fragmented segment involves small establishments that employ 10-15 people supplying plastic or metal.  Unusual delays in payments from automakers immediately after the lockdown created a cascading effect. Demand rebounds in July Wholesale dispatches by five of India’s top six car and SUV makers in July jumped 84 percent compared to June as demand from rural and semi-urban pockets recorded robust growth. Such a comeback in demand surprised even the automakers and other market watchers. Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Honda and Toyota,  the five automakers, who control more than 70 percent of the market , sold 157,762 units in July compared to 85,933 units in June. The comparison is sequential because many dealerships continue to remain shut due to the Covid-19 disruption. Ashok Minda, Chairman and Group CEO,  Minda Corporation,  said: “Almost all plants have started operations but sometimes a particular zone is in a containment area that houses our facility and that is when supplies get impacted for some days. Besides the lockdowns, we face issues like worker availability. We are presently working at 40 percent utilisation, on an average, across 30 plants in the country”.

Addressing shareholders in the 75 th  annual report, Chandrasekaran said, “As we look ahead over the next two years, we anticipate a tremendous deal of transformation stemming from COVID-19. Consumer behaviour will change in numerous ways, from demanding more integrated digital experiences to prioritising health and safety features across purchasing decisions.” Though an expensive alternative to public transport, personal mobility will become a more accepted way of travel in the future. This is already seen through an uptick in demand for small hatchbacks during June and July as reported by the country’s largest carmaker  Maruti Suzuki . “The move to ‘slow’ travel and personal (versus public and/or shared) transport may shape future demand for passenger vehicles. Greater scrutiny will be placed on building environmental sustainability and climate resilience into the very core of business models,” Chandrasekaran added. Tata Motors is pushing through a strategic plan that will see the passenger vehicle business including electric vehicle division placed under a separate entity. The company is trying to bring in a partner who can assist in getting future ready but has declined to cede control of the division. “The global auto industry has grappled with multiple issues during the year. On one hand, we saw greater clarity emerge on Brexit; yet on the other hand, mounting trade tensions, muted global growth and enhanced regulatory norms have fundamentally changed the contours of the business environment,” Chandrasekaran observed. The Indian auto industry faced an unprecedented year, marked by significant headwinds. Domestic auto sales declined by 18 percent in FY20, the lowest since the data series was introduced in 2001. Alongside a broad economic slowdown, regulatory changes—including changed axle load norms and the migration to BSVI emission standards—fuelled uncertainty for both consumers and suppliers.

While truck-makers have reported a revival in certain segments in India, the manufacturers of earth moving machines have also seen demand rev up. All of JCB’s 90,000 backhoe loaders that are with their owners are back in action after a blackout of nearly two months. Rural and semi-urban pockets are leading the charge, helped by a fresh push by the government under schemes such as MNREGA and PMGSY, a top official at JCB, India’s largest construction equipment manufacturer, said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol. Green shoots? “We monitor the utilisation of our machines on an everyday basis. We have almost 90,000 connected backhoes in the field using telematics,” said Subir Chowdhury, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, JCB India. “In the months of April and May their activity went down to zero. But in June we saw a ‘V’ shaped recovery, which was better than even June 2019. In July, due to the onset of the monsoon, the utilisation slowed down but it was still on par with the July 2019 level”. Backhoes, which are a common site at real estate sites, are wheeled excavators used extensively in earth-moving operations. Several of these backhoes were put to use in the construction of bunds, creation of water bodies and construction of rural roads in June and July, according to Chowdhury. JCB’s other product, tracked excavators, which are used for heavier loads, also saw usage shoot up to 80-85 percent in June and July, indicating signs of an economic revival. Construction equipment industry Following bumper production of rabi crops till June and encouraging sowing of kharif crops so far, even sales of new earth-moving machines have gathered pace. In June, JCB sold a little over 2,000 machines, on par with its June 2019 sales. Sales in July recorded a further improvement of 10 percent, in line with July 2019. In 2017, the construction equipment industry in India recorded sales of 61,000 units, which grew to 82,000 units in 2018. Due to the slowdown in the economy, sales in 2019 dropped to 69,000 units. JCB’s 2019 tally stood at 37,000 units, a reduction of 15 percent from 2018. “We would be lucky if we get to 50 percent of last year’s sales this year. But everything depends on the October-December quarter because traditionally it is the strongest quarter for the industry besides the January-March quarter”, added Chowdhury.

(Image source: Bugatti) To start off, the Type 57 is probably the most coveted classic car in the world today. Out of the four that were every built, only three are accounted for. The fourth Type 57 was lost during World War II and if found, could be valued at well over $100 million. (Image source: Bugatti) The La Voiture Noire, however, is based on the Bugatti Chiron. While most of the car loses the flowy nature of the original Type 57, subtle hints like the dorsal fin that runs along the bonnet and the roof still exists. (Image source: Bugatti) To add to that, the Noire is powered by a beast of a motor, as Bugatti is already well known for. The quad-turbo W-16 engine is capable of churning out horses of up to 1,500 PS and twisting forces of 1,180 pound-foot. This gives the car a top speed of nearly 261 mph and a 0-60 mph time of just 2.5 seconds. (Image source: Bugatti) The La Voiture Noire will however, be even more exclusive considering that only one will ever be built and there is already a buyer set. But, there is one catch, the company has said that the car is still in production and will probably take two-and-a-half years to complete. (Image source: Bugatti) The Bugatti La Voiture Noire sold at a skyscrapping $18.68 million which roughly translates to Rs 140 crore (at the time of writing).

While the base gets a 1.4 kWh battery pack, the Vitesse and Pur Sang get a 2.8 kWh packs. To make it a little more fun for more experienced drivers, the Vitesse and Pur Sang come with a ‘Speed Key’ to unlock the motor’s full potential. Of course, there will only ever be 500 of these babies made, and while all of the units have already been sold out, Bugatti did mention that it is possible for customers to join a reserve list in case any of the original buyers pull out.

The Mumbai-based company witnessed heavy demand from the replacement market and to some extent from two-wheeler manufacturers. After a total shutdown of production and sales operations in April, which spilled over to May, demand for tyres shot up after a gradual reopening in June. Several vehicle makers, including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company have already hit pre-Covid sales levels. Sales of car makers Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, too, are close to hitting pre-Covid levels. Tractor sales in June were the third highest in 30 months, while production hit a 20-month high. Stocking up for future lockdowns Speaking to Moneycontrol, Kumar Subbaiah, Ceat’s Chief Financial Officer,  said:  “It is important for us to produce and keep inventory because lockdowns could occur again or there can be some restrictions. Two-wheeler companies are operating at reasonable levels and other OEMs are operating a little low. Our plants are operating at 80 percent utilisation to meet the demand and increase inventory.” Tyre demand from the replacement market was high all through July. This became possible after almost every retail outlet across the country became operational. Inventories thus began shrinking faster than expected across segments, with the exception of the commercial vehicle industry, which saw subdued utilisation levels. Besides its six manufacturing facilities in India, Ceat has more than 4,000 dealers and channel partners, including more than 300 two-wheeler tyre distributors. The company is the leader in the two-wheeler tyre segment in the replacement segment. Sales close to normal levels “We normally maintain our inventory at 30-day levels and they vary on actual sales versus forecast. A comfortable level is 25-30 days. Right now our inventory levels are 21-22 days. With regard to the replacement demand, our sales are close to what they were prior to the Covid-19 impact. For OEMs it depends on the numbers they are running at,” added Subbaiah. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 06, 2020 09:39 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Gurugram-based Spinny will acquire 100 percent of Mumbai-based Truebil for an undisclosed sum, top officials of both the companies confirmed to Moneycontrol. By the end of FY20 India's used car market is estimated to be over 4 million cars. “We have had significant growth last year which is when Truebil was the largest player in the segment. Truebil had scaled down its operations when COVID-19 hit the market. We are not merging the business of the two companies but we are instead acquiring the technology platform, brand and the products of Truebil,” Niraj Singh, founder of Spinny said. Truebil is a natural fit for Spinny. While Truebil scaled up its technology to depend on algorithm ably aided by other analytical tools for generating best consumer engagement, Spinny was able to raise funds in a relatively short period. In less than a year Spinny raised a little over $57 million from a bunch of popular investors including Nandan Nilekani-owned Fundamentum Partners, SAIF Partners and Accel Partners. The deal also gives Spinny the entry into the Mumbai market. The company presently has operations in Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida and Hyderabad. “We will allow the Truebil platform to operate for some time. We will later reassess if it makes sense to continue with it or should we merge it with Spinny. We operate in cars priced between Rs 3 to Rs 10 lakh, whereas Truebil operates in the band of Rs 2-4 lakh,” Singh added. “Even if we had not acquired Truebil we would have started building that part of the business on our own because we had earmarked separate investment for it. But what would have taken us two years to achieve, we have done it now by this acquisition,” Singh added. None of Truebil’s investors such as Kalaari Capital, Inventus, Shunwei Capital and Japanese investor Joe Hirao will stay invested after the buy-out by Spinny. Both Truebil and Spinny were born in 2015 and were competing with each other in a couple of markets such as Delhi and Bengaluru. While Truebil was slower in expanding its business to new cities Spinny was much faster. Truebil had to even scale down its business following the COVID-19 outbreak and there was no transaction happening on its website since the past few months due to the deal. “We realised it might take more than a year to revive the business and there was a player who had the backing of the Tier 1 VCs and it was not making sense for us to continue fighting in the same market with the same business model. That is why we decided to join forces. We build the technology part of the business and Spinny raised capital. So it was a very ideal fit,” Shubh Bansal, one of the seven co-founders of Truebil, told Moneycontrol. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 07, 2020 10:25 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Satyakam Arya, managing director and CEO, DICV, said: “Fleet owners have affordability issues, given the slowdown, and they are looking for reliable and quality-assured used vehicles rather than a new truck. The introduction of BS-VI norms has pushed costs higher.” How does the market work? The market works in two ways: selling an old truck and exchanging an old truck for a new one. In the first instance, a Bharat Benz truck owner can take his old truck to any DICV outlet, where the company will refurbish the vehicle, provide warranty, certify it and offer funding support to the buyer. The company will also transfer the residual warranty of the vehicle to the new buyer. The exchange programme will function very much like a car exchange programme - evaluation of condition of the truck, price offer to the buyer, and finally the sale. The sale amount will be adjusted with the price of the new DICV vehicle. Only trucks in the Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV) segment and Bharat Benz brands will be accepted by the company initially. Used-truck market in India Like the used-car segment, this is a highly unorganised market, though as per estimates, for every new truck, three old ones are sold. With around 100,000 trucks and 3,000 buses on Indian roads, DICV is trying to create a new stream of business and strengthen its brand image in the market, heavily dominated by  Tata Motors ,  Mahindra & Mahindra  and  Ashok Leyland . DICV, which has products in the M&HCV segment, designed and developed in-house by the company, will restrict the used-vehicle business to the truck segment. In FY20, the M&HCV truck segment clocked sales of 184,648 units, a fall of 47 percent, compared to FY19, as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Chennai plant production Arya said that DICV will very likely start its second shift in production from its Chennai plant next week. The company has seen green shoots in the construction, mining and infrastructure segments. In 2019, DICV saw its wholesale volumes plummet 36 percent to 14,474 units, compared to 2018. Retail sales dipped by 29 percent to 15,196 units during the same period. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 07, 2020 02:32 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The company has written off the investment it had made towards this project, a top official of the company said. Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA), a subsidiary of  Mahindra & Mahindra , was looking to set up a plant in Michigan in the US and had even signed a letter of intent with the RACER Trust, the Indian automaker had said in August 2019. The RACER Trust was created in March 2011 by the US bankruptcy court to clean up and offer for redevelopment properties and other facilities owned by the General Motors Corp before its 2009 bankruptcy. Anish Shah, deputy managing director and Group CFO, M&M said: “The $500 million investment by us in MANA was subject to us winning the US postal services bid. We chose not to participate in that bid. We were shortlisted as the final four. What had been invested so far was a very small amount which was essentially in preparation of the bid and all of that has been written off."" The company claims that the investment in MANA would not have met the return on equity of 18 percent targeted by it. This move comes less than a quarter after M&M decided to stop fresh investments in its loss-making subsidiary SsangYong Motor Company and the shutdown of Genze, an electric two-wheeler manufacturing business in the US. The MANA facility, which was likely to come up in Flint, would have manufactured small delivery trucks, 180,000 units, for the United States Postal Service (USPS), had M&M won the contract.

The automaker has invested significant capital in the segment and that gives it confidence to find partners, M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in a conference call. To a query on whether it was open to partnerships in the EV business, Goenka said, ""We are open to it and working on it. We currently are engaged with multiple interested parties to invest in Mahindra Electric and the process is going on."" ""We have invested in Bangalore, and just completed investing in Chakan for high range of batteries. We are fairly well invested and that gives us advantage in India which would be driving growth in the segment going ahead,"" he noted. He said the company has many products on the ground and there are new launches planned over the next 12 months as well. ""So finding partners for Mahindra Electric won't be such a difficult task as it would be for some other companies,"" Goenka emphasised. He said M&M is keen on becoming a significant player in the EV space with Mahindra Electric on one side and its Italy-based arm Automobili Pininfarina (APF) with its high-end models on the other end. Goenka said M&M is also evaluating to further extend the APF product portfolio going ahead. The launch of the first super sports car from the APF stable, Battista, which was to happen this year, has now been moved to next year due to the COVID-19 scenario. M&M also said it is seeking investors for its Korean arm SsangYong Motor Company  (SYMC). ""We are looking for investors for SYMC as we have decided not to further invest in it. The South Korean firm is in dialogue with certain investors and we will be announcing that at an appropriate time on the status of those investors,"" Goenka said. The M&M board had decided on April 3 this year that the company will not make any further investment in SYMC other than USD 32 million to help the Korean firm tide over the immediate fund requirements. On the domestic business, M&M Executive Director - Automotive and Farm Sectors, Rajesh Jejurikar said demand is very robust in tractors and the only challenge is to manage the supply chain disruptions. On the 80 per cent drop in automotive revenue in the first quarter, he said, ""With that kind of drop in revenue, anyone would come under pressure. We, though, believe that we have done better than all our peers. Our performance has been pretty robust in context of 80 per cent drop in revenue."" Goenka said he does not foresee any dark clouds on the tractor side but challenges do remain in the passenger vehicle segment. ""On the auto side, ramp up is somewhat more difficult due to the complexity that we have in supply chain,"" he added. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 07, 2020 09:12 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The auto maker, which is present in the country through a wholly-owned subsidiary, also expects production across its two plants in India to touch pre-COVID levels by the end of next month, helping it reduce waiting time for its recently launched products, especially the fifth generation city. ""With festive season ahead of us, we are hoping for a month on month improvement in sales volumes going forward and expect to start showing positive recovery on monthly volumes in second half of fiscal,"" Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) Senior Vice President and Director (Sales and Marketing) Rajesh Goel told PTI in an interview. The response to the recently launched models has been extremely positive and is helping the company create excitement in the market and improve buying sentiment, he added. The all-new City, in particular, has received a great response from the market, both in terms of enquiries and contracts, and has been able to stimulate the mid-size sedan segment, Goel noted. The customers for City have always been very discerning and as per the initial response, the top end ZX variant, with numerous segment-first features, is getting the maximum demand of almost 60 percent, he added. In another trend, more than half of the first month bookings are for CVT (automatic) variants as compared to 40 percent in the fourth generation City, Goel said. Besides City, the company recently introduced new WR-V and BS-VI compliant diesel trim of Civic sedan. It is now gearing up to drive in new version of Jazz. Goel said HCIL was in the middle of BS-VI transition when the national lockdown happened, leading to a sharp fall in monthly sales. ""Ever since our production resumed in mid-June, our priority has been to quickly roll out the models,"" Goel said. He added that the company is now in the process of gradually ramping up its production to reduce waiting period for the City. ""Both our plants in Greater Noida and Tapukara are operational since mid-June. Our production is currently at about 60 percent of pre-COVID level. ""When we resumed operations in mid-June, we had started at 25 percent level. This is being further ramped up and we hope to reach 100 percent of pre-COVID production level by end of September,"" Goel said. The approach has been to target and achieve safe, stable and efficient operations, he added. The plants started with limited capacity and lesser manpower to ensure strict adherence to the safety and distancing norms, which are a must in the current prevailing scenario, Goel said. The auto maker is also monitoring its dealers' operational status on a daily basis as they continue to get impacted due to intermittent local lockdowns for COVID-19 prevention and day-wise restrictions, he noted. The company's sales network was operational in about 80-85 percent of market in mid-July as against 95 percent after Unlock 2.0, Goel noted. ""Currently the dealerships are again open in about 92-94 percent of the market and we are adapting to the start-stop method of operations. Since a lot of sales processes have been digitalised, it is surely helping us to continue reaching out to our customers even during lockdowns,"" he added. Goel said almost one-third of the company's sales network had adopted the new corporate identity guidelines by the end of 2019-20 fiscal. ""Due to COVID crisis, currently we have prioritised areas that are essential for dealer business sustenance over this initiative as it requires capital investment, specially related to hardware. Once business situation normalises, we will resume the initiative,"" he said. ",,"Last Updated : Aug 09, 2020 08:10 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/this-week-in-auto-manpower-shortage-is-keeping-vehicle-makers-on-the-edge-5665151.html,This week in Auto: Manpower shortage is keeping vehicle makers on the edge,"From zero percent in April, the auto industry was able to reach 90-95 percent sales in July compared to the same month last year. Vehicle makers are pushing their suppliers to produce as much as possible. However, majority of the people who made up the labour force at the component making plants had moved back to the villages amid the lockdown. We take a look at this issue in today’s automotive wrap of the week. But first here is the complete brief of all the major events in the automotive space this week. Mahindra looks for partnerships in EV  Homegrown auto major  Mahindra and Mahindra  (M&M) is  looking for strategic partners for its electric vehicles business  in order to further scale it up, a top company official said on August 7. The auto major, which reported a 94 per cent decline in consolidated profit at Rs 54.64 crore for the June quarter, also said there is no impact of COVID-19 on its EV launch plans. Kia unveils Sonet After tonnes of spy pics and teasers, Kia has  finally unveiled the Sonet compact SUV . First showcased at the 2020 Auto Expo, the Kia Sonet is the second car to be premiered first in India. Mahindra cancels bid to make vans for US Mahindra & Mahindra has bailed out from  the bid to manufacture small delivery trucks for the United States Postal Service  that is worth $6.3 billion. The company has written off the investment it had made towards this project, a top official of the company said. Spinny buys Truebil Spinny and Truebil, two of India’s biggest start-ups in the online used-vehicle space,  have joined hands to tap the burgeoning second-hand car market . Gurugram-based Spinny will acquire 100 percent of Mumbai-based Truebil for an undisclosed sum, top officials of both the companies confirmed to Moneycontrol. Toyota releases teaser of new SUV The second car to come out of the Suzuki-Toyota partnership  will be the Toyota Urban Cruiser , the teaser for which has dropped on the company’s twitter handle. The new SUV will be based on the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza and a launch is expected to be sometime during the festival season between late August and early September. Tata Motors seeks approval to pay MD Tata Motors is seeking shareholders’ approval  to ratify the payment of minimum salary to its MD and CEO  Guenter Butschek, a German national, for FY20 -- and a hike for FY21. According to the company, Butschek’s total remuneration for FY20 was Rs 19.27 crore. The Companies Act 2013 prescribes a certain limit for executive payment if a company has ‘inadequate profits’. Increasing vehicle demand amid manpower shortage Three months after scenes of reverse migration emerged from almost every city the auto component industry continues to remain impacted by the shortage of manpower keeping vehicle makers on the edge. Scores of auto parts suppliers are operating with less than half of their full labour strength though there is a need to increase production rapidly. The intense lockdown seen in April had driven out the migrant workforce back to their villages resulting in the shortages. With 30 operational plants in India, Minda Corporation is one of the largest suppliers of auto parts to the vehicle manufacturers. Though the company has seen a gradual uptick in number of workforce in the past month there is still a shortfall. Ashok Minda, chairman of Minda Corporation said, “We do have to face issues like lack of manpower and we are working on how to get them back. So many workers have gone back to their villages and to bring them back is a real challenge. We cannot readily hire new people since they have no training. Because it is a highly skilled job the productivity goes down.” Other bigger suppliers report that contract labourers are facing family pressure against rejoining their previous employers for fear of contracting COVID-19. Though irregular but transport options have been thrown open by the government in a limited manner. “Our entire permanent workforce is still with us. If we have a labour issue then it is with the temporary workers. The families of people who have gone back also need to be convinced of rejoining work and that is not easy. It may be difficult for them to find jobs in their native places but they won’t readily come back,” said a top official of a tyre manufacturing firm. Skilled jobs involving working on a production line and vehicle testing to name a few, cannot be delegated to a temporary worker even after providing training. The permanent workers have the required educational qualification that temporary workers lack. Vehicle manufacturers are thus not directly impacted by the reverse migration of workers.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/brand-nexa-a-success-story-from-maruti-stable-5643671.html,Brand Nexa: A success story from Maruti's stable,"Brand Nexa, which has become the third largest automobile retail brand in five years since inception in July 2015, is arguably one of the best examples of how customer-centricity can create a premium brand. Nexa, the premium retail brand from the automotive leader  Maruti Suzuki , commands a little over 11 percent of the car market volume and contributes more than 20 percent of Maruti's annual volumes, grossing over 30,000 units per month even in this downturn. ""Nexa marks the first initiative by a carmaker here to go beyond selling cars by creating a new format of retail experience. In these five years Nexa, with its intelligent brand associations and unique customer experiences, has delighted over 1.1 million customers as it completed five years in July,"" Maruti Suzuki executive director for marketing and sales Shashank Srivastava told PTI. Since the launch with the sole brand S-Cross, today Nexa sells five premium models of Maruti. In October 2016, it rolled in the Baleno, the premium mini SUV, which was followed by the Ignis, a hatchback in January 2017. In April 2017, it launched the premium sedan Ciaz, and in August 2019 the XLB, a crossover MPV, was rolled out. At present, there are 370 Nexa showrooms across 200 cities. But Srivastava is cautious about expansion this fiscal given the pandemic blow to the industry. ""Today, Nexa is the third largest retail automobile channel with a market share of 10-11 percent. At present, Nexa contributes close to 20 per cent of our overall sales. With Nexa, we are able to attract modern urban consumers,” Srivastava added. In just four years and two months, the brand grossed up 1 million customers in September 2019 and by July 2020, added 1 lakh more customers to the take the total customer family to 1.1 million. Elaborating further, Srivastava said the first step was to tap the fast evolving market wherein market research has established that driven by rising income levels, many were looking forward to a more customer-centric and a prersonalised experience in car-buying. ""So, to offer a personalised experience, we have set up a content management system which has helped us personalise communication to each customer depending on the digital signals in their purchase journey,"" he said adding nearly half of Nexa customers are under-35. Further, Srivastava said that ""we had to ensure that the buying experience is carried forward to the after-sales service and other post-sales connect"". As part of the premirisation of customer experience, Nexa had in August 2016 tied up with the Lakme Fashion Week, and in January 2019 Nexa Music was launched. Srivastava said for the brand Nexa, the first step was to tap the fast evolving market wherein market research has established that driven by rising income levels, many were looking forward to a more customer-centric and a prersonalised experience in car-buying. ""So, to offer a personalised experience, we have set up a content management system which has helped us personalise communication to each customer depending on the digital signals in their purchase journey,"" he explains, adding nearly half of Nexa customers are under-35. According to Srivastava, the way forward is to staying connected with the customer throughout the year. ""Having established a digital connect throughout the year, currently we are focusing on a connected digital + CRM experience with initiatives such as social CRM,"" he said and added that to digitise the entire process of car-buying process, it is making financing also online. Already, 21 of the 26-steps car-buying process is digitised and a ""pilot for a one-of-its-kind digital finance marketplace that assists a customer in her car-buying process by providing easy finance is underway now"", he noted. To drive the customer experience to the next level it has introduced Nexa Music under which it creates new original English music; Nexa Lifestyle wherein it creates avant garde lifestyle; and Nexa Journeys under which offers unique travel experience to customers.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/tata-motors-seeks-shareholder-approval-on-salary-package-of-md-guenter-butschek-5641341.html,Tata Motors seeks shareholders’ nod to ratify MD and CEO Guenter Butschek’s salary for FY20,"Tata Motors is seeking shareholders’ approval to ratify the payment of minimum salary to its MD and CEO Guenter Butschek, a German national, for FY20 -- and a hike for FY21. According to the company, Butschek’s total remuneration for FY20 was Rs 19.27 crore. The Companies Act 2013 prescribes a certain limit for executive payment if a company has ‘inadequate profits’. Tata Motors suffered a loss of nearly Rs 7,500 crore (Rs 7,083 crore as per Section 198 of the Companies Act) in FY20. The excess of Rs 11.82 crore is what Tata Motors wants to ratify through a special resolution. “Pursuant to the provisions of Section 197, in respect of the payment of managerial remuneration in case of no profits or inadequacy of profits, the company may pay such remuneration over the ceiling limit, provided the members’ approval by way of a special resolution has been taken for payment of the minimum remuneration for a period not exceeding three years,” Tata Motors said in the FY19-20 annual report. The special resolution that Tata Motors is proposing also seeks to hike Butschek’s salary for FY21. Will shareholders’ approval be easy? For Tata Motors, history offers little solace. In 2014, shareholders had turned down the company’s pay plan for three of its senior executives. The company failed to secure the required 75 percent votes in a postal ballot to compensate the then Executive Director (Commercial Vehicles) Ravindra Pisharody, Executive Director (Quality) Satish Borwankar, and the legal heir of former Managing Director Karl Slym in excess of the limits for the year that ended in March 2014. Even in Butschek’s case, this is not the first time that the company is seeking such an approval. Tata Motors had sought a similar approval and won it at the time of his appointment in 2016 for three years. With that period ending, the company is forced to approach the shareholders again. Accodring to Shriram Subramaniam, Founder & MD, InGovern, India’s first proxy advisory firm, in 2014, there was a loss in Tata Motors India, but, as a group, the company was profitable. The Companies Act states that any Indian company that is making losses needs to seek shareholders' approval for remuneration of EDs. Hence, even this year, they have placed such a proposal, he said. Butschek’s performance and salary Barring FY19, Tata Motors posted a net loss each year since Butschek assumed office in February 2016. In fact, an auto analyst, who did not want to be named, said his report card on Butschek is “not good”. “The company had just one profitable year, it has not been able to shrug off non-core investments, it missed an opportunity to tie up with global majors, and did not fully recover from the losses in the M&HCV market share,” he explained. “Successes with products like Tiago helped, but no traction was seen with Harrier. I have seen no effect as raw material cost to sales in the standalone entity is up each year from FY16 to FY 20 -- from 67.9 percent to 74.2 percent,” he said. “Payment of remuneration to Butschek from February 15, 2016, to March 31, 2019, was well within the statutory limits approved by the members,” Tata Motors said in its annual report. The payment of minimum remuneration would require fresh members’ approval in the event of inadequacy of profits in the 4th and 5th year of Butschek’s tenure -- from February 15, 2019, to February 14, 2021. Considering that the company had adequate profits for FY19, the said members’ approval is required for the period April 1, 2019 to February 14, 2021,” Tata Motors further explained. “As per the company’s budget/ business plan for FY20 approved by the board in March 2019, the company was expected to have adequate profits for FY20 and therefore no resolution was passed in the previous AGM held in 2019,” Tata Motors stated. For FY21, Tata Motors wants to give Butschek a pay hike of 20 percent to Rs 23.11 crore (subject to achievement of targets). This will be his fifth and final year as director of Tata Motors. In comparison, Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka received Rs 10.03 crore as salary for 2019-20, and Maruti Suzuki MD Kenichi Ayukawa Rs 5.02 crore for 2018-19. As COVID-19 hit all automakers hard, the profitability of Tata Motors was affected by about Rs 500 crore and free cash flows by about Rs 2,000 crore during FY20. Butschek and Tata Motors Butschek’s appointment at Tata Motors came after two years of intense global search under former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry following the death of previous MD Karl Slym. Butschek became the third foreigner to head Tata Motors (after Carl-Peter Foster and Slym). Before joining Tata Motors, he was the chief operating officer at Airbus, where he spent 30 months. Before that, he worked at Daimler AG for around 25 years, leading functions such as production, industrialisation and procurement. The last role he held in Daimler was that of president and chief executive of Beijing Benz Automotive Co, a joint venture between Daimler AG and Beijing Automotive Industrial Holding in Beijing, China.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/road-test-chinese-robotaxis-take-riders-for-a-spin-5669191.html,Road test: Chinese 'robotaxis' take riders for a spin,"Chinese entrants in the race to put autonomous vehicles on the road are bringing ""robotaxis"" online in hopes that a hired-car format can be the key to unlocking wide acceptance of the futuristic technology. It is expected to be years before cars that operate completely without human intervention are unleashed owing to lingering technological, regulatory, and safety hurdles. But as China challenges US tech dominance, Chinese players such as Baidu, Alibaba-backed AutoX and ride-sharing king DiDi Chuxing recently launched autonomous taxi pilot projects in cities around the country. Similar efforts are under way in the US, and AutoX's chief executive Xiao Jianxiong told AFP the first fully-autonomous vehicles could be on the roads by the end of the year. Robotaxis or delivery services are considered ideal for accumulating the driving time and huge data cache needed for cars to ""learn"" and become safe enough. Chinese consumers -- known for eagerly embracing e-commerce, online payments and other digital solutions -- are lining up for a spin in DiDi Chuxing's self-developed autonomous taxis at a Shanghai pilot project launched in June. Underlining the work-in-progress nature of the concept, a DiDi staffer occupies the driver's seat, ready to take the wheel if needed. But Da Xuan, a 24-year-old social-media worker, leapt at a taste of the future. 'Smooth' running ""I heard companies like Uber or Tesla were doing autonomous driving, so I was curious what Chinese companies were doing, whether they can go into production, and if so, what will the (riding) experience be like,"" she said. ""It was very smooth,"" Da said, adding that she would feel safe in such a car. Test subjects use DiDi's mobile app to plot a ride through suburban roads in a Volvo fitted with a crown of tech hardware topped by a spinning radar device. The vehicle confidently sets out, accelerating, braking, signalling and turning on its own in real traffic as a female voice calmly narrates: ""Yielding for crosswalk""; ""Your car has been disinfected"". When a large truck abruptly swerved in front, DiDi's AI driver smoothly applied the brake. Like any student driver, however, it still needs practice. At one stop sign, it braked so abruptly that passengers lurched forward. And any impromptu deviation from the plotted route requires human intervention. But Meng Xing, chief operating officer of DiDi's autonomous driving company, told AFP its AI system ""is already smart enough to handle most of the situations"", and safety drivers almost never need to touch the steering wheel or brakes. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, known for his overly rosy predictions, raised eyebrows in July by saying the US electric carmaker could have a completely autonomous car ready this year, which analysts have dismissed. 'Long way' to go Paul Lewis, who heads policy research at the Washington-based non-profit Eno Center for Transportation, told AFP that hopes are being ""reset"" as the pace of the technology's development disappoints. ""Technology developers are starting to realise the limits of artificial intelligence and the benefits of the human brain in handling some of these tasks,"" he said, adding we remain ""a long way"" from driverless cars. But Xiao of AutoX expects a ""sizeable"" deployment of the vehicles -- without safety drivers -- could take place in two to three years, with regulations and technology being the main obstacles. ""It's just a matter of time and effort to make it happen,"" he said. ""There are no open scientific questions left to be solved."" Tech giant Baidu has plans for autonomous car testing bases in more than 10 Chinese cities including Beijing, with a 45-strong robotaxi fleet already on trial in central China's Changsha city, plying an area of around 130 square kilometres (50 square miles). Its Apollo Park in the capital, which opened this year, has more than 200 vehicles while Apollo general manager Li Zhenyu told employees in a letter that ""the era of unmanned driving in traffic will definitely arrive"".

Work on commercially launching an electric cruiser scooter is on schedule and going ahead as planned, a senior company official said. Showcased at the Auto Expo in Greater Noida in February 2020, this scooter will be launched next year. It will have a top speed of 100 km per hour. “We cannot say that the pandemic has had zero effect on the sector or players. However, our plans are more or less the same as before. We will be launching our first electric bike this year in the third quarter. It was supposed to get scheduled in the second quarter. We have also simultaneously accelerated our expansion plans and marketing activities,” Jeetender Sharma, founder and MD, Okinawa Autotech, told Moneycontrol last week. To be priced under Rs 1 lakh, the Oki100 fully battery electric bike will also have a top speed 100 km per hour, and a range of 150 km. The Oki100, which will hit the market during the festive season, will be the cheapest electric motorcycle in India. Okinawa Autotech sold 28,261 units during FY20 as against 36,134 units sold in FY19. “While setting targets, we also consider people who were hesitant towards EVs. To our surprise, there has been a drastic change in people’s opinions and understanding. There was an overwhelming response from Tier-II and Tier-III cities,” Sharma said. Okinawa is setting up a Rs 200-crore manufacturing plant, with  a capacity of 1 million units at Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. Phase-I of the new plant will commence in 2020-21.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/market-share-at-all-time-low-but-tata-motors-aspires-to-enter-league-of-top-three-5606961.html,Market share at all-time low but Tata Motors aspires to enter league of top three,"Tata Motors intends to regain ground it ceded to rivals and re-enter the league of top three carmakers in the country. But that may be easier said than done, given how its market share has sunk to a new low. Tata Motors finished fourth in FY20 with a share of 4.98 percent of the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, as per data shared by the Society of India Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). It clocked sales of 138,238 PV units, a fall of over 40 percent, and far greater than the 18 percent decline posted by the industry during the same year. The country’s top three carmakers – Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) control 75 percent of the domestic PV market. M&M finished third in FY20 with a share of 6.73 percent, Hyundai had 17.48 percent and Maruti Suzuki led the pack with 51.03 percent. For Tata Motors, a market share of under 5 percent is less than a third compared to its lifetime best market share of 16.5 percent, clocked in 2007, as per SIAM data. The fall in share has come on the back of a series of new product launches, vigorous expansion of the dealer network and a number of consumer-focussed initiatives. Nexon, Tiago, Tigor, Hexa, Harrier and several variants and derivatives were launched by the company during the past two to three years. Uphill task In a Finance Partnership Meet organised by Tata Motors, the company said it aspires to not only be among the ‘Top 3 OEMs in terms of total sales’ but also double its sales in the ‘medium term’, as well as grab the number 1 or number 2 positions in the segments the company is present in currently. If it has to get even to the third spot, currently occupied by Mahindra & Mahindra, the Mumbai-based company will either have to almost double its FY20 market share or hope other companies lose share. The company refused to provide any dates for these targets to be achieved. “The 2x target sales pertains to passenger vehicles. As this and the target to become one of top three in the PV segment is the aspiration, no timeline is indicated”. In the past two-three years, Tata Motors has increased its dealership count by more than 50 percent to around 860. At least another 100 dealerships are planned this year with the aim of doubling dealer throughput. “We plan to increase the number of outlets per dealer to provide a greater catchment area and increase sales”, Tata Motors said in the presentation. New launches Tata Motors is betting on the success of new launches and those in the pipeline to be able to meet those aspirations.

It forecast an operating loss of 470 billion yen ($4.5 billion), which would be its biggest according to Nissan data that goes back to 1977 and much larger than a consensus estimate of a 262.8 billion yen loss drawn from 20 analysts polled by Refinitiv. It predicted revenue would plunge by a fifth to 7.8 trillion yen and global vehicle sales would fall 16.3 percent. Years of aggressive expansion, particularly in emerging markets, has left Japan's No. 2 automaker with dismal margins, an ageing portfolio and a tarnished brand. Still reeling from the 2018 arrest and ouster of former CEO Carlos Ghosn, Nissan unveiled a far-reaching restructuring plan in May that calls for a dramatic reduction in production lines and its vehicle model range. In the first quarter, Nissan posted an operating loss of 153.9 billion yen, its second consecutive quarterly loss after falling 94.8 billion yen into the red in January-March. Nissan's woes have highlighted the fragility of its automaking partnership with France's Renault SA which has also announced a major restructuring as it rows back on policies pursued by Ghosn, now a fugitive wanted on charges of financial misconduct in Tokyo. Ghosn denies the charges. ",,"Last Updated : Jul 28, 2020 02:21 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

As part of the arrangement, TKM already sources Baleno from MSI and sells it as Glanza after making certain changes in the design and features. The automaker is now ready to bring in the second product under this arrangement during the early part of the upcoming festive season. ""India loves the sub-four meter compact SUV category. And this segment alone is now 10-11 percent of the total passenger vehicle sales,"" TKM Senior Vice President sales and marketing Naveen Soni told PTI. In fact, compact SUV is the only segment which has shown growth in the last year, he added. ""So we have been evaluating this segment for a long time and now the time has come that we are announcing that this festive season we will have our own compact SUV in the market,"" Soni noted. He said SUV sales have been growing in the country and in that too sales of the entry level or sub four meter SUVs have been witnessing a steady growth in the domestic market. It may be due to road conditions or other factors, but the fact remains that the compact SUV segment has been growing, Soni said. ""New products bring excitement into the market. Irrespective of the market conditions, new products have helped the market to grow for different manufacturers. For us it is important, because we were not present in this growing segment,"" Soni said. He expressed hope that by the time the product is launched things may become better in terms of COVID-19 scenario in the country. TKM has already sold over 25,000 Glanza units in the last one year and its share in TKM overall sales has been increasing. Soni noted that around 40-50 percent Glanza customers were first time buyers for a Toyota product and that he expected a similar kind of response for the upcoming model as well.

The development brings to an end Tata Motors’ six-month-long head-hunting exercise, which began after the announcement of current JLR CEO Ralf Speth’s retirement. Bolloré will become the fourth executive (after David Smith, Carl-Peter Forster and Ralf Speth) to take charge of JLR since its acquisition by Tata Motors 12 years ago. In a statement on the appointment, N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said: “I am delighted to welcome Thierry to Jaguar Land Rover. An established global business leader with a proven track record of implementing complex transformations, Thierry will bring a wealth of experience to one of the most revered positions in the industry.” In the hotseat Bolloré assumes office on September 10, and will have his task cut out from Day 1. Jaguar Land Rover recorded a GBP 469 million net loss in FY20, which was preceded by a massive GBP 3.32 billion net loss in FY19. Its retail sales stood at 508,659 vehicles in FY20, down 12.1 percent year-on-year, including a significant impact on sales in the fourth quarter as well as other market challenges. The company’s China joint venture (CJLR) recorded its first loss in five years in FY20. One blip in a quick rise to the top Bolloré, who had travelled to India in mid-2019 to unveil the Renault Triber, had raised questions over the Renault-Nissan alliance’s internal investigation of former boss Carlos Ghosn. The soft-spoken auto industry veteran was allegedly ousted from Renault after Nissan concluded that his ‘concerns were unfounded and were based, for the most part, on inaccurate information and speculation’. Bolloré had described the manoeuvring against him as a “strong-arm coup”. Before the unceremonious exit though, Bolloré had swiftly climbed the career ladder. He began his career at French tyremaking company Michelin, where he went on to become vice-president of the Aircraft business. Bolloré later joined auto parts manufacturer Faurecia before eventually joining Groupe Renault and becoming its CEO within six years. At Renault, Bolloré was responsible for accelerating the company's EV adoption. Industry observers note that Renault's electric cars are beginning to do well in Europe. The carmaker may launch its first EV in India in 2021. The experience will come in more than handy at JLR. The JLR challenge Bolloré’s appointment at Jaguar Land Rover comes amid a massive belt-tightening exercise by the two British brands, which began after they recorded their second consecutive annual loss last year. To bring in efficiencies JLR is going aggressively after costs and cutting back on undeclared but unviable projects. ",,"Last Updated : Jul 29, 2020 07:17 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/maruti-suzuki-may-double-production-from-gujarat-demand-reaches-90-of-pre-covid-levels-5617271.html,Maruti Suzuki may double production from Gujarat; demand reaches 90% of pre-COVID levels,"Increase in demand from first time buyers and gradual lifting of the lockdown has pushed demand for  Maruti Suzuki  cars to climb to 90 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels forcing the company to start another shift at its Gujarat plant. Strong uptick in retail sales which was nearly double than the wholesales in June has led to inventory levels of Maruti Suzuki come down by end of last month. While domestic passenger vehicle wholesales (company to dealer) stood at 51,300, its retails (dealer to consumer) stood at slightly over 90,000 units. As against the usual 30-35 days, the car market leader’s inventory days dropped to 25 by end of June to just 80,000 units. For the industry the inventory is estimated to be at 170,000 units, according to a senior executive of Maruti Suzuki. “If retail sales, bookings and enquiries are the parameters for defining demand then I would say that it is around 85-90 percent of the pre-Covid-19 times. The bounce back has been encouraging and we are looking forward with a lot of optimism,” Shashank Srivastava, director (sales and marketing), Maruti Suzuki said in an analyst call. First time buyers  Owing to the need for social distancing the new car market has seen a spurt in first time buyers. While there has been a general increase in demand for used cars, the smaller entry level hatchbacks in the new car industry have seen a rise in demand since the past few weeks. “The share of first time buyers has gone up by a substantial 5.5 percentage points. The data on enquiry levels does indicate that there is a uptick in the demand for smaller cars than previous years and this has also reflected in our consumer research. We have to see what the demand patterns likely be because it is true that when the consumers revert to the original state the trend has been towards the SUV type,” Srivastava added. The share of first time buyers has gone up even in the two-wheeler segment where companies like Bajaj Auto have reported that demand in July bounced back to 95 percent of the same month last year. Maruti Suzuki also believes that besides first time buyers demand from repeat buyers may also pick up. “In June there were some states where retails were positive over retails of June last year as many states reopened. But there were some states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu continue to be affected negatively,” added Srivastava. Increasing production The Delhi-based car maker has more than doubled production compared to June already. From less than 2,000 units a day clocked in June the maker of Swift and Baleno is currently producing more than 4000 units a day. It is now looking to add another shift at its parent’s Gujarat plant from August-September which will push its total output up by 22 percent. The plant currently produces 900 units a day and could be ramped up to 1,800 units a day. This will come in handy as preparations are underway to launch the S-Cross petrol in the first week of August. ",,"Last Updated : Jul 29, 2020 07:29 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/hero-xtreme-160r-review-a-muscular-lightweight-that-surprises-you-at-every-corner-5613031.html,Hero Xtreme 160R review: A muscular lightweight that surprises you at every corner,"Hero MotoCorp launched the Hero Xtreme 160R in India after it was first showcased at the Hero World event. The bike is finally here and has started reaching dealerships as well. The good part? We got to test the bike out for ourselves, too. Let’s start with the looks The Xtreme 160R has pretty radical styling for a bike coming out of Hero MotoCorp. Ever since the Impulse (no, the Xpulse came later), the company has been adding focus on the bike’s designs to make them more appealing to the wider, more youthful audience. The Xtreme 160R, too, follows in this suit. The bike packs in a fairly muscular design with sharp edges all around. The tank is nice and beefy and the tail section gives off this stubby, chopped off vibe that we usually see in naked sports bikes. But the best-looking thing about this bike has to be the headlamp. The all-LED unit looks like it has been taken off a robot and is repurposed to illuminate our streets while riding. At the rear too, the tail lamp gets a smoked finish, so, while the tail lamp isn’t on, it flows into the rear section inconspicuously. What is it powered by? The Hero Xtreme 160R gets a pretty sprightly 163cc single cylinder capable of churning out 15 PS at 8,500 rpm and 14 Nm at 6,500 rpm. This may not be best-in-class figures, but it is a number that changes when you ride. Transmission is handled by a 5-speed constant mesh gearbox. Suspension comes from a standard telescopic forks up front and a 7-step preload adjustable monoshock in the rear. As for braking, the Xtreme is available in two options. The disc at the front is standard, but you get a rear drum variant and a rear disc variant but the price gap between the two isn’t that wide. However, both variants still only get single channel ABS. How’s it like to ride? To start with, I just have to say that the bike is extremely light. The single disc variant gets a kerb weight of just 138.5 kg while the double disc is a kilogram more. This light weight factor adds a whole lot of fun for your ride. It feels sprightly even at low speeds and the run up to the top of the meter is progressive too with no real dead spots anywhere in between. Now, the company claims a sprint from 0 to 60 km/h in 4.7 seconds. This is a pretty good time in the 160cc segment, and while my lack of right tech didn’t let me confirm it, I don’t think I doubt that that claim. My gripe, however, came from two things. The gears for one. While the shifting itself is smooth internally, it felt like I needed to twist my ankle further up or further down to change a gear. A slightly shorter shifter or maybe even a smaller action would probably help here, but it’s nothing you can’t get used to. Then there is the more troubling issue. The suspension is stiff. In stock setup, you can feel almost every bump on the road. This definitely comes in handy when you’re carving mountainsides, but on Indian city streets, you’re going to have to slow down a bit. But, what makes up for this, in the little way it can, is the seat. It is wide and strikes a pretty decent balance between soft and stiff. Coming down to riding dynamics, you sit in a fairly upright position and as with all naked sports bikes, the footpegs are rear set. So, every time you take your foot away from ground, you know you can have some fun. The bike’s handles are a standard flat bar and the length provides you with decent leverage. Add to that the light weight and the bike is extremely flickable. I saw myself cutting through traffic like its nobody’s business. The tyres too, 100/80 at the front and 130/70 at the back gives you enough confidence, even in the wet conditions that I was testing the bike in. The engine refinement, too, is something special. All through my ride, I was able to hear the engine, but not in a bad way. The only time I actually felt the engine, however, was when I was at speeds in excess of 70 km/h. Vibrations, even above those speeds were muted and a long day in the saddle at cruising speeds would probably do very little to give you that buzz in the hands and feet that you would normally get. What about build quality? First off, the Xtreme 160R is a beautiful bike to look at, even from up close. But if you get in too close, you start to see some imperfections. The design is big and chunky but it is the minor details that may not have been given much focus. For example, the switchgear, while it worked properly, looked like poor quality plastic. The switches themselves had a tactile feel while clicking, but they were a little sticky on the fingers. Next is the instrument cluster. Now, I’m not sure, if it was just my bike, but the it was shaky. Every little bump in the road and the dash would move forward and backward as if saying, “Hey! Look at me. I can dance.” The cluster itself is fairly informative and the blue and white LCD display is pretty to look at, and while fairly informative, I missed a gear position indicator. And the last thing I would probably want to ask is why would Hero put in a kick start on a bike that is so beautifully built. Batteries these days are refined enough that a kick starter goes completely unused for years and its only when a rider doubts the amount of fuel in his tank, that he will ever use it which, obviously, again will be useless. All of these, save for the dancing dash are minor details and can be overlooked easily. The rest of the bike seems to be built strong. There were no creaks, no hisses, no squeaks for the time that I had the Xtreme and that is comforting enough. To top off the safety on the Xtreme, Hero has also added in a side-stand cut--off feature so you won’t go riding around with your side-stand down. Now, how much do I have to shell out? Well, this is a Hero Xtreme 160R. Anything more than aggressive pricing was stupid to expect. The rear drum brake variant retails at Rs 99,950 while the dual disc variant gets a sticker price of Rs 1,03,500. At this price point, the Hero Xtreme 160R is the cheapest bike in its category rivalling the likes of the TVS Apache RTR 160 4V, Suzuki Gixxer, the Bajaj Pulsar NS160, Yamaha FZ V3.0 and the Honda X-Blade.

In view of a bleak global, Indian and European outlook, the tyre major has adopted a ""cautious approach"" with focus on employee safety, conserving cash, re-engineering production and cutting down all avoidable costs while continuing to spend on R&D, e-training and brand building, among others. ""FY20 was a tough year by all measures. While the auto industry had been on a slow growth path even in FY19, the last year proved to be a complete dampener for the industry due to poor consumer sentiment, increased cost of ownership on account of higher insurance cost, and higher financing cost owing to the liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector,"" Kanwar said in his address to shareholders in the company's annual report for 2019-20. He, however, said the company is still bullish about the economy bouncing back and ""did see signs of a recovery in the third quarter, but the fourth quarter witnessed headwinds in the form of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent nation-wide lockdown"". ""India saw its economic growth hitting an 11-year low of 4.2 percent for FY20, even as the auto industry sales fell 18 percent, adversely impacting the entire tyre industry, which, in turn, declined by 8 percent, in terms of total tyres manufactured,"" Kanwar said. Looking ahead, he said ""it is reasonable to assume that the uncertainty will continue. I personally do not see an early end of this 'new normal'. Yet, the show must go on and we are already adapting and finding opportunities for growth."" Kanwar further said the company's immediate priority is the safety and well-being of its employees, even as it continues to make the ""'new normal' our normal"". Despite the crisis, he said, ""We have been able to organise the virtual inauguration of our seventh manufacturing plant in Andhra Pradesh, India in June 2020. ""This was closely followed by the opening of our facility to manufacture high-end bias and steel radial tyres for the two-wheeler segment in Limda, Gujarat, India in July 2020."" On the overall outlook, Apollo Tyres said against the bleak global, Indian and European outlook, it has adopted a cautious approach. ""The focus is on employee safety and conserving cash. The company is re-engineering production and cutting down all avoidable costs and focusing on the good costs like R&D, e-training and brand building, among others,"" it said. COVID-19 has grave consequences for the automobile industry and all related sectors, with most automobile manufacturers having announced temporary closure of plants due to collapsing demand, supply shortages and government measures. ""OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in India are forecasting a de-growth of 30-40 percent in FY21 demand given the BS-VI implementation and price increase, COVID-19 impact, poor consumer sentiment and liquidity crunch, which in turn will seriously impact the tyre industry,"" the company said. Apollo Tyres Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Neeraj Kanwar said, ""Looking ahead at FY21, we are aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown will have serious implications on the business. It has been a difficult few months for us – having to temporarily close our plants and making tough decisions on cost-cutting across the board."" However, he said the company is looking at challenges as opportunities and has already launched multiple initiatives under the DRIVE leadership theme to re-engineer Apollo Tyres.

Talking to analysts, K N Radhakrishnan, director and chief executive officer, TVS Motor Company, said on Wednesday: “Retail  demand has been much higher than whatever we were able to produce and supply to the market. The inventory is much lower than the usual 35 days’ stock. We increased prices in Q1 by 0.7 percent and by 0.4 percent in Q2.” TVS, India’s fourth-largest two-wheeler manufacturer, is yet to see full-fledged operations from its dealers. In July, only 85 percent dealerships were open. This went down to 75 percent in recent days, following lockdown measures by local administrations. “In those areas where dealerships are open, demand is almost similar to last year’s,” added Radhakrishnan. Bajaj Auto, India’s third-largest two-wheeler player, increased prices in July. The company hopes this would improve gross margins on motorcycles going forward, considering that no substantial raw material cost increase is predicted. Soumen Ray, chief financial officer and president – finance, Bajaj Auto, said in a recent conference call: “There has been multiple rounds (of price hike) in various parts of the portfolio in various rounds. The last one we undertook was on July 7, which was only for 3 or 4 models”. Bajaj Auto claimed that the first 10 days of July 2020 saw demand reaching 90-95 percent levels of July 2019. It subsequently came down to 80-85 percent, like TVS, after further lockdowns were announced at local levels. Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker, has already reduced discounts in July compared to the June quarter. Senior company officials said that during the April-June quarter, the company doled out an average discount of Rs 25,000 per vehicle at the wholesale level, but at the retail level, the discounts were below Rs 20,000 per vehicle. The current trend of discounting by Maruti Suzuki is much lower than the record average discounts of Rs 33,000 per vehicle, the highest in its 37-year history, doled out during the December quarter. Demand for  Maruti Suzuki  cars climbed to 90 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels in July,  forcing the company to ask its parent company Suzuki Motor Corporation to start an additional shift  ",,"Last Updated : Jul 30, 2020 10:48 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

Though market trends in the past 2-3 weeks suggest an uptick in demand at the retail level, sales are still on the lower side and this is forcing companies to go cautious on new production capacity addition. Oversupply will put pressure on the already stressed dealer community as well as add a variety of costs. Ashok Leyland The inauguration of a Rs 170 crore bus manufacturing plant by Chennai-based  Ashok Leyland   in Andhra Pradesh has been kept on hold following the slowdown in demand. “The plant is ready but it depends on market demand, which will determine when we start operating it. Production will depend on demand,” Vipin Sondhi, Managing Director, Ashok Leyland, told Moneycontrol in an interaction. According to data provided by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the medium and heavy bus segment, where Ashok Leyland is the leader with a share of 45 percent, recorded sales growth of just 2 percent in FY20. During the recently concluded quarter ended June, volumes in this bus segment crashed 98 percent. This was because of lockdown rules preventing free movement of passengers as well as regulations such as a cap on the number of passengers boarding a bus. Suzuki Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), the parent of car market leader  Maruti Suzuki  (MSIL), has decided to delay the start of production at its third plant, in Gujarat, by more than six months. The plant, which is ready, was originally supposed to commence operations in June but will now start in 2021. The new plant would have added 250,000 units per year to the SMC and MSIL aggregate annual tally of 2.05 million units. However, looking at the production trends in July, both the entities will not exceed 70 percent of their peak production capacity. The Gujarat plant is operating with a single shift and plans are afoot to start a second shift in August-September, according to Rahul Bharti, Senior VP, corporate planning and government affairs, Maruti Suzuki, while addressing analysts on July 29. The passenger vehicle segment slumped 50 percent in June (78 percent in the June quarter), while MSIL recorded a fall of 50 percent in June (80 percent in the quarter), as per SIAM data. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), the country’s second largest two-wheeler maker, has decided to delay commissioning of its third assembly line in Gujarat. This new line, which is ready for production, would have added 600,000 units annually to its total yearly tally of 6.4 million units. However, by the end of June, HMSI was utilising less than 20 percent of its total installed capacity. Like its peers HMSI, also witnessed a rise in retail sales in July, which, sources said, had reached 85-90 percent of their pre-Covid-19 levels. The two-wheeler industry contracted 39 percent in June (74 percent in the June quarter), while HMSI’s volumes fell 55 percent (81 percent in the June quarter).

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/panasonic-aims-to-boost-energy-density-in-tesla-batteries-by-20-5621411.html,Panasonic aims to boost energy density in Tesla batteries by 20%,"Panasonic Corp plans to boost the energy density of ""2170"" battery cells it supplies to Tesla Inc by 20 percent in five years and commercialize a cobalt-free version ""in two to three years"", the head of its US EV battery business said. This is the first time Panasonic, a leading cell provider for the world's top electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, has outlined these targets, putting down a marker in a highly competitive sector to stay ahead of the game. Panasonic introduced the ""2170"" lithium-ion cells, with the nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) cathode chemistry, for Tesla's Model 3 in 2017. Researchers say it already has the highest energy density at above 700 watt-hour per litre. With an even higher density, these cells could help increase how much an EV can run on a single charge, while also paving the way for smaller batteries and roomier car interiors. A cobalt-free version on the other hand would cut reliance on a costly and controversial component, which makes batteries stable but poses ethical issues given controversial labour conditions in top producer the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long said he wants to move to zero-cobalt battery cells. Panasonic has already cut cobalt content to under 5 percent in the NCA cathode and plans to improve its batteries in stages, its U.S. EV battery chief Yasuaki Takamoto told Reuters. But the firm has declined to link its battery roadmap to Tesla's future models. Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla's exclusive battery supplier. The U.S. firm has partnered with South Korea's LG Chem and China's CATL. CATL is supplying Tesla with low-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that contain no cobalt. According to Takamoto, the average density of LFP battery cells is less than half the level of Panasonic's latest NCA batteries. He did not name any companies. '2170' CELLS Panasonic has already developed technologies resulting in a more than 5 percent increase in the energy density of ""2170"" cells. From September, the firm will start converting lines at its factory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla as it prepares to further boost the energy density of the cells, Takamoto said. To control safety risks associated with higher density and less cobalt, Panasonic is adjusting the composition and design for better thermal stability, Takamoto said.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/in-india-a-diminished-nissan-bets-big-on-a-small-suv-5625901.html,"In India, a diminished Nissan bets big on a small SUV","By any measure, Nissan Motor Co Ltd has had a dreadful run in India. A push to revive its lower-end Datsun brand flopped, sales have slumped 60 percent over the past five years and its sole plant in the country is operating way below capacity. But the amount of money and energy that Nissan - battered by scandal and expecting a record $4.5 billion annual operating loss - will spend to turn its fortunes around in India will hinge on the sales of one vehicle, its new Magnite compact SUV, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The SUV may also determine how much heft Nissan will wield as it and alliance partner Renault SA thrash out their respective roles in the Indian market. Unveiled this month and due to be launched either late this year or early 2021, the Magnite will be Nissan's first new vehicle in India in two years. Moreover, it will be just one of three Nissan-branded models in the market after two others were pulled in April when tougher emission rules kicked in. ""Magnite will buy Nissan a couple of years to figure out a plan for India and the SUV's success will determine whether it invests more or scales down operations,"" said one source. A second source called the sport-utility vehicle Nissan's ""last hope"" to revive the brand in India. Japan's No. 2 automaker has, however, no plans to withdraw from India, where it has invested over $800 million, and discussions about strategy are ongoing, the sources said. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. The Datsun brand is likely to be phased out as part of a global overhaul, they added. Nissan's only other models in India are three Datsun cars. Nissan said in a statement to Reuters it is committed to the Indian market and has a well-defined strategy for ""a sustainable and profitable business"". It declined to comment on sales goals for the Magnite. WHO WILL LEAD? Nissan's internal plans call for sales of 1,500 to 2,000 Magnites a month, the first source said - which if realised would exceed the average India monthly sales it achieved last business year with seven models. The SUV will be priced ""aggressively"", the sources said without elaborating. Originally developed as a Datsun model, it is now expected to have features typically seen in a mid-range car, including a touchscreen and cruise control. But the market is difficult - demand has been pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic and India's compact SUV segment is crowded. The Magnite will also go head to head with models from industry leaders - Maruti Suzuki's Brezza and Hyundai Motor's Venue. Complicating matters, Nissan's India sales outlets have almost halved in number from around 270 in 2018 as dealers walked away from the brand, the third source said. The source added that Nissan hopes to export the model. India represents a particularly thorny market for Nissan as it and Renault drastically restructure in the wake of former leader Carlos Ghosn's shock 2018 arrest and ouster. To save resources, clarify decision-making and prevent overlap, the two firms have agreed to a 'leader-follower' strategy in key markets where one spearheads operations and the other is more in the backseat. Nissan, for example, is taking the lead in the United States, China and Japan. But India is the sole major market where no such decision has been made, with the automakers saying they will coexist and compete. ""If Magnite is successful, Nissan has stronger ground to argue to be the leader in India. If not, it is back to the discussion on who is bigger and smaller,"" said the first source. On one hand, Nissan has less than 1 percent of the India market, selling just 18,000 vehicles in the last business year. Renault sold five times as many cars in the country. But Nissan holds 70 percent of their jointly owned plant in the southern city of Chennai and exported 80,000 vehicles from the plant in the last business year, five times more than Renault.

New launches coinciding with the lockdown made the situation worse for the company.. Chery Jaguar Land Rover (CJLR), the 50:50 joint venture that assembles the Range Rover Evoque, Land Rover Discovery Sport, Jaguar XEL, XFL and the E-PACE, reported a net loss of GBP 224 million during FY20, its biggest since starting operations in 2012-13. The JV company reported profits in four consecutive years starting FY16 but not before reporting losses in each of the previous three financial years ending March 31. For the most part of FY20  Tata Motors -controlled Jaguar Land Rover depended on direct exports from the UK of fully built vehicles to China for volumes as volumes from the JV business remained low. Though sales of JLR vehicles contracted on the whole in China the fall in CJLR volumes was steeper than the direct imports from the UK. CJLR wholesale volumes dipped 14 percent to 49,450 units in FY20 whereas wholesale volumes of direct imports declined by just 5 percent to 38,312 during the same year. Total JLR wholesale volumes slipped by 10 percent to 87,762 units in China during FY20. Besides the impact of Covid-19 on production and subsequently on wholesales CJLR suffered model transition blow wherein an existing model was made to exhaust from the retail network fully before the company dispatched the new versions. Made by CJLR the Discovery and Discovery Sport got hit because the new versions of them were slated for launch in the final quarter of last year while the older versions were on their way out. But, as of the June quarter of FY21, CJLR’s retail volumes (JLR did not share wholesale numbers till the time of printing this article) bounced back to nearly the same level as the same quarter in FY20. At 14,083 units, CJLR retails were nearly on par with the same quarter in FY20 even as retails of direct imports declined 5 percent to 9,643 units. Further, the comeback of China in Q1FY21 was so strong that the country once again became the single largest market for JLR accounting for a third of JLR global volumes with sales of 23,726 units followed by North America with volumes of 20,833 units. Rising litigation claims  In its annual report Jaguar Land Rover declared that there were claims and potential claims of GBP 40 million (Rs 385 crore) against the group as by end of FY20. This was more than double compared to FY20 and also the highest ever. In FY19, the JLR Group had claims of GBP 17 million (Rs 160 crore). “These claims and potential claims pertain to motor accident claims, consumer complaints, employment and dealership arrangements, replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the services by the Group or its retailers,” JLR declared in the annual report.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/in-electric-car-market-its-tesla-and-a-jumbled-field-of-also-rans-5587271.html,"In electric car market, it’s Tesla and a jumbled field of also-rans","Although it has become the world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla still has to figure out how to become consistently profitable, reduce quality problems in its luxury cars and more quickly turn alluring prototypes into mass-produced vehicles. One area where it hasn’t had much to fret about: competition. Over the last year or so, several automakers, including Audi, Jaguar and Porsche, have added heralded new models intended to cut into Tesla’s electric dominance. But they have barely made a dent, at least in the United States. Sales of the Jaguar I-Pace, an electric sport utility vehicle similar to the Tesla Model Y, have totaled just over 1,000 this year. Porsche has reported similar sales for its electric sedan, the Taycan. Audi, which has grown steadily in the United States over the last decade, introduced an electric SUV, the E-tron, last year, and sales have sputtered. So far this year, Audi has sold just under 2,900. In many states, the car is advertised at prices 13% or more below its list price — unusual for an Audi. “Obviously from the numbers we’re seeing, these cars aren’t setting the world on fire,” said Karl Brauer, an independent auto analyst. “It was a mistake to think that just because these cars were on the market that people were going to buy them.” General Motors has fared somewhat better with its Chevrolet Bolt, which the company introduced in 2016. The company has sold over 8,000 Bolts this year. Sales of the Nissan Leaf have topped 3,000. Tesla, which does not break out sales by country, is clearly operating at a different level. State data analyzed by Cross-Sell shows that 56,000 new Teslas have been registered this year in 23 states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas. Analysts said Tesla’s 50-state sales total probably exceeded 70,000 cars. Globally, the company delivered about 180,000 cars in the first six months of the year. Of course, electric vehicles, including Tesla’s, represent a tiny proportion of auto sales, which totaled more than 17 million in the United States last year. Electrics are a bigger part of the new-car market in Europe, and Tesla faces more competition there than in the United States, but not a lot more. China has many homegrown electric carmakers, but they tend to make cheaper vehicles that do not directly compete with Tesla’s offerings. Regardless of the market, though, EVs are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Tesla’s dominance can be explained in part by its head start. It has been selling electric cars in significant numbers since 2012. The company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, have also built a fervent fan base that few other automakers, save perhaps high-end sports car brands like Porsche or Ferrari, can claim. Tesla has long offered innovations other companies are only now trying to match, such as wireless software updates that can add features or fix glitches without trips to dealerships. One of the biggest shortcomings of competing models is range — the distance an electric car can go before needing to be recharged. The maximum for the E-tron and Taycan is about 200 miles. The I-Pace and Bolt go about 235 to 260 miles. The least expensive Tesla Model 3 has a range of 250 miles, and most of the company’s cars go 300 miles or more on a single charge. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said that the Audi, Jaguar and Porsche vehicles were superior to Teslas in some ways, such as look, feel and finish, but that their limited range had put off many buyers. “The difference is too great for a lot of consumers to ignore,” he said. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have been slower to introduce electric vehicles in the United States, where both companies plan to start selling new electric SUVs next year. Mercedes late last year delayed the introduction of its model, the EQC. And BMW, which introduced its i3 in 2014, has not built on that early start. That has left the field open for Tesla, and investors have taken note. The company’s stock has soared this year, climbing from $510 in early January to about $1,600. The opening of a second assembly plant in China and the introduction of the Model Y have lifted optimism that Tesla will lead a global transition from gasoline-powered cars and trucks to zero-emission electric vehicles. Of course, Tesla’s success is not guaranteed. It hasn’t reported an annual profit since its founding in 2003. But on Wednesday, the company reported a $104 million profit in the second quarter — the first time it has reported profits for four quarters in a row. The performance surprised analysts, who were expecting Tesla to lose money because the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut down its main factory, in California, for about two months. Still, Tesla has struggled to match the quality levels of traditional automakers, and it is spending heavily on Model Y production and developing a pickup truck, a semi truck and other vehicles. It is also building a third factory in Germany, and planning a fourth. Its Autopilot driver-assistance system has won widespread attention, but its shortcomings have come under scrutiny after fatal accidents during its use. This month, a German court ruled that Tesla had exaggerated the system’s abilities and created the false impression that Tesla cars with Autopilot could drive themselves. The company has long claimed that the data collected by its cars shows that the system makes its cars safer than others on the road. Officials at Tesla did not reply to requests for comment. Moreover, a stronger competitive push may come soon. By the end of this year, Ford Motor expects to start selling an electric SUV, the Mustang Mach-E, that is styled to look like the company’s famous sports car. It is promising a version of the car with a range of 300 miles or more. GM has said it will offer a new Bolt with longer range by the end of this year, followed by more than 20 other electric models over the next three years. Volkswagen next year will begin selling an electric SUV, the ID4, which will also have a range of 300 miles. The company on Monday started taking orders in Europe for the ID3, a hatchback that will sell for about 10,000 euros less than the Model 3; the car is not expected to be sold in the United States. And various startups are raising billions of dollars to challenge Tesla. Among the most promising is Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, Ford and other investors. The company, which is based in Michigan, plans to bring out next year a pickup truck and an SUV that can go up to 400 miles. Coming even sooner is a new company, Polestar, owned by Volvo and Volvo’s Chinese parent, Zhejiang Geely Holding. The Polestar 2 is a hatchback that is supposed to go 275 miles before needing a recharge and has the kind of agility — zero to 62 mph in less than five seconds — that appeals to aficionados. It will start at $59,900 in the United States, and buyers will be able to claim a $7,500 federal tax credit and state incentives. The company will also sell the Polestar 1, a sports coupe that starts at $155,000. Polestar recently opened sales centers in Santa Monica, California, and New York City. Sales are expected to begin in the next few weeks. Other showrooms should pop up next year in Boston, Miami, Denver and elsewhere. The company has made a big bet on technology. Its cars are controlled by Google’s Android software, which enables drivers to operate many parts of the vehicles through the same kind of natural voice commands that many people use with smartphones. “You can use Google Assistant to utilize everything from maps to changing the climate in your car to asking trivia questions,” said Gregor Hembrough, the head of Polestar’s U.S. operations and a Volvo veteran. And since Polestar is an EV-only company like Tesla, Hembrough is counting on pulling customers from traditional carmakers, not just its bigger rival. He said the company expected to sell “thousands” of cars this year, and “tens of thousands” in 2021. ",,"Last Updated : Jul 23, 2020 03:51 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

This will be the car’s second proper update since 2013, but the car was introduced in India only in 2018. It did get a minor revision since then, but the new Yaris will get a more wholesome update. Design-wise, the new Yaris will take inspiration from the other sedans in Toyota’s lineup. For example, the front fascia is updated with a new bumper and a larger two-part grille. The headlamps look like LED units wrapped around the front with chrome accents running across the width while the foglamp housings have changed too. There is no view of the rear just yet, but we expect changes in the bumper to match with the one up-front as well as in the tail lamps.

Shareholders either ask tough and unsettling questions to some of the country’s richest businessmen or use the opportunity to just click a picture, shake hands with them or even recite a poem dedicated to them. But thanks to the coronavirus pandemic most of that action will be missed as all AGMs are to be held virtually. And perhaps that was what the Bajaj Group patriarch Rahul Bajaj missed the most at the recently held AGM of Bajaj Auto. More on this later in the copy but first here is a complete look at events that made headlines in the auto space during the week. Chandrasekaran warns of uncertainties at JLR After posting its second consecutive annual loss, in FY20,  Tata Motors -controlled Jaguar Land Rover  will be further challenged by economic uncertainties this year  stressing a greater need to ‘work with partners’, N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said in the JLR annual report. “The new fiscal year will be marked by further uncertainty, reflecting the varying pace of economic recovery in different regions. This will require a continued focus on financial discipline and further efficiencies, building on the considerable success of Jaguar Land Rover’s Charge+ and Accelerate programmes,” said Chandrasekaran. Demand back to near-normal levels Direct consumer purchases from showrooms of two-wheelers in July have jumped to 85 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels  and are seen improving further in the coming months for India’s third-largest bike maker  Bajaj Auto . While certain urban markets are underperforming because of lockdown-related measures, rural demand has compensated for the shortfall, said a top official of Bajaj Auto talking to analysts over a conference call. JLR China JV records first loss in five years  The Chinese joint venture of Jaguar Land Rover  recorded its first financial loss in five years as operations got crippled by the COVID-19  outbreak. New launches coinciding with the lockdown made the situation worse for the company. Chery Jaguar Land Rover (CJLR), the 50:50 joint venture that assembles the Evoque, Discovery Sport and the Jaguar XE, reported a net loss of GBP 224 million during FY20, its biggest since starting operations in 2012-13. Bajaj Auto plans overseas design centres Bajaj Auto’s  international focus will  be further bolstered with the opening of two vehicle design centres in Europe and Thailand  followed by an assembly plant in Brazil. The Pune-based company, India’s third-largest two-wheeler maker, will set up its first design centre outside of India in Bangkok followed by one in Europe, a top company official said on July 22 Rahul Bajaj at 13 th  Bajaj Auto AGM Wading through some technical glitches on the way Bajaj Auto managed to successfully become the first automotive company in India to hold an annual general meeting (AGM) virtually. Though only five of its 16 directors were present in person for the AGM held at Akurdi in Pune, perhaps the one factor that left patriarch Rahul Bajaj discontented was the absence of regular shareholders inside the auditorium. Until 2019 Bajaj Auto shareholders left no seats empty at the multi-seater AGM meeting room situated on the ground floor of the Bajaj Auto corporate building on the old Mumbai-Pune highway. While many were from Pune itself, several travelled from Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Delhi. Known to speak his mind freely, the 82-year-old Bajaj has faced repeated health issues in the past few years. Despite this, he was seen mingling with the shareholders post the AGM every year exchanging smiles and pleasantries. This made it one of the rare times in a year when Bajaj personally met the shareholders. But with the orders from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, this rather limited private affair was missing at this year’s Bajaj Auto AGM when the senior Bajaj had to follow directives from the moderator to conduct the AGM virtually. “I miss today the regular and real AGM where hundreds of shareholders are in this room and outside the room. When I see them face to face I recognize them, some are fresh faces. That gives us a great feeling of happiness and satisfaction which unfortunately just does not come from this virtual meeting”, Rahul Bajaj, chairman, Bajaj Auto said at the 13 th  AGM.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/two-wheeler-sales-on-recovery-path-across-domestic-export-markets-bajaj-auto-5599731.html,"Two-wheeler sales on recovery path across domestic, export markets: Bajaj Auto","Bajaj Auto is witnessing a strong revival in demand for two-wheelers in the domestic as well as international markets, even as it continues to face headwinds in the three-wheeler segment, a senior company official has said. The company, however, expects to have a much clearer trend at its disposal by the next month-end to see whether the current demand for two-wheelers is just a pent-up demand from previous months or the industry really is back on a revival path. ""We are seeing month-on-month improvement in sales. There was no sale in April while the decline was very large in May. June was significantly better than May and July is much better than June,"" Bajaj Auto CFO Soumen Ray told PTI. The demand scenario is coming back pretty sharply and it could be a pent-up demand as well, so the clarity would emerge only in August, he added. In April-June, the company sold 1,85,981 units in the domestic market, down 69.55 percent from 6,10,936 units in the same period last year. Ray, however, noted that the domestic three-wheeler segment will take some time to revive. ""Such vehicles are mostly bought by taking loan. So why would someone like to start an EMI when there is no business? Passenger three-wheeler recovery will happen once this once these lockdowns end,"" Ray said. The company' CV sales (three-wheelers) in the domestic market during the first quarter of the current fiscal plunged by 93.87 percent to 5,282 units as against 86,217 units in the April-June period of the last fiscal. When asked if the company expects things to turn around by festive season, he said: ""Certainly, hope so, there is no reason why it should not happen. However, we will have to see August. If we have reasonably strong August then we are set for a good festive season."" He said that company's Waluj (Aurangabad) plant is operational and there were only a very few workers who were in quarantine due to COVID-19. The factory is currently running with capacity utilisation of around 65-70 percent, Ray said. When asked if the company had earmarked any capex on capacity expansion this fiscal, he said: ""Our installed capacity is 63 lakh units per annum and right now we are operating at sub 50 lakh. Last year, we did around 48 lakh units so there is no question of putting up additional capacity."" On exports, Ray said that almost every market the company caters to has been impacted due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Fortunately, we have an order book and we continue to deliver. In retail terms we are witnessing similar phenomenon as we are seeing in India. Two-wheelers are coming back much faster than three-wheelers,"" Ray noted. Bajaj sold over 2,13,000 units in the international markets in first quarter as compared with 4,71,691 units in the same period last year. KTM, in which Bajaj Auto has 48 percent stake, is witnessing very strong revival in countries like Germany, Australia and the US, he added.

The company which had planned at least ten new introductions this year in India is also sticking with its plans, although some products may be late due to global supply chain issues. ""I am optimistic, people would also want to celebrate but it might not be the biggest of all gatherings in October or November, whenever it happens, because restrictions which I am sure will remain. But I hope people will really appreciate and also want to celebrate,"" Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director and CEO Martin Schwenk told PTI. He was responding to a query as to how the company sees recovery in the automotive industry and the consumer sentiment outlook by around the festive season. Schwenk, however, said a lot would depend on the coronavirus pandemic management in India, specially freedom of people's movement and also on how the country's economy grows. ""Even if it is a managed normalcy that would really help in reviving sentiment,"" he said adding ""wherever we have stability in the market (in terms of COVID-19 related restrictions), the sentiment is developing positively."" He said there have been challenges where there is localised lockdown with potential customers who planned new purchases postponing their orders. Reiterating that the company's mid-term and long-term perspective on ""India is strong and remains unchanged"", he said, ""We see this (current slowdown) as a temporary setback, we are well advised to continue with our plans we have set out, that includes product launches."" In the beginning of the year, the company had announced plans for at least ten new introductions, including upgrades. ""We will continue with our product launches but we will have delays. I still believe that the ten launches we had announced in the beginning of the year will be on but let's see where we end up,"" Schwenk said. As the current COVID-19 situation is just not in India and global supply chain has been impacted, it has ""led us to re-prioritise our launch schedule"", he added. ""In principle the plans have not been changed but we will have to face a few delays here and there,"" he admitted. So far the company has launched seven out of the ten planned introductions. Citing the example of the company's electric car EQC which it had planned to launch in India in April, he said, ""It will now take a couple of more weeks..."" Stressing on the importance of continuing to bring new products to drive up consumer sentiment, Schwenk said a product like the company's top-end SUV GLS has helped in giving traction to sales of other SUV models like the GLC and GLE.

The launch, however, has been restricted to only two cities (Pune and Bengaluru) so far, while the company is working to honour delivery commitments for bookings made by customers a few months ago. “While we believe that there is a strong case for electric vehicles (for the Indian market) it is mainly at the product level because obviously EVs are very convenient and environmentally friendly. But at this stage their commercial proposition is very weak. The high battery costs limit the development of the category,” said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, at the 13th Bajaj Auto annual general meeting. In addition to the two-wheelers, Bajaj Auto, the market leader in three-wheelers, is also working on electric solutions for the three-wheeler segment and also for quadricycles. In fact,  its electric three-wheeler was scheduled  to enter the market in 2017 itself, years before the earlier target of 2020. Prices still high Though global battery prices have fallen by 85 percent since 2010, from more than $1,000 per kWh to $150 per kWh in 2020, according to a research report released by Avendus Capital, they remain discouragingly high for mass adoption. “It is quite probable that cost will reduce through technical innovation, and the category, in due course, will be widely prevalent. But the timing of this occurring is highly uncertain and hence our approach is to undertake a limited development of the electric portfolio both in 2-wheelers and subsequently in 3-wheelers so that we build our capabilities and move up the learning curve and be prepared for the future”, added Sharma. China dominates battery supply The Avendus Capital report has predicted a further fall of 27 percent in the prices of batteries to $110 wKh by 2025. China controls nearly three-fourths of the global lithium cell manufacturing capacity, according a BloombergNEF report. Further, given the uneasy geopolitical situation between India and China, unhindered supplies of battery cells from China are not guaranteed. This is even as a handful of automotive companies have started work on installing battery cell manufacturing plants in India. India had instituted heightened scrutiny on shipments originating from China, Hong Kong and Macao at sea ports leading to severe congestion and delays of multiple days.  Bajaj's Chetak also depends on components ",,"Last Updated : Jul 28, 2020 08:23 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

The ability to give electricity back to a grid from an electric vehicle may not be new but it is still intriguing. What Audi is terming as Vehicle to Home (V2H) is a concept that is fairly new. This is also because the use of electric cars is only just picking up steam. The new tech will allow a person to power their home using the car’s battery when the car is not being used. Audi is developing the V2H with Hager Group a German electricals installations manufacturer for bi-directional charging on the Audi e-Tron. In the test grid, the car uses DC wall charger with a 12 kW charging capacity and a home storage unit with a 9 kW capacity. Because of this and the overall DC voltage level in the grid, the car didn’t require an inverter making it very efficient. This also allows the car to function as an energy storage unit for houses powered by solar panels and energy. With this, the car can store the energy generated and gathered by solar panels when it is sunny and then power the house at other times. This could also help in times of blackouts.

The 57-year-old, who resides in Malaysia and owns a restaurant in the northern state of Kedah, pleaded guilty to four charges of violating a mandated 14-day home quarantine order upon his return from India in July. He was also fined 12,000 ringgit ($2,864) by the Alor Setar Magistrate's Court, which held a special hearing at a Kedah hospital where the accused was undergoing treatment, Bernama reported. Authorities had earlier said the man, who initially tested negative for the coronavirus, had left his home during the quarantine period to visit his restaurant. After a second test came back positive, dozens of people, including the man's family members, restaurant workers and customers, were found to have been infected. A total of 45 cases linked to the cluster have since been reported in at least three Malaysian states. Malaysia has gradually lifted strict lockdown measures since May after successfully containing the spread of the pandemic, but has warned that curbs may be reimposed after more than a dozen new clusters emerged in recent weeks.

The invention is aimed at providing seamless transactions using geo-locations and user identifiers. With this, the company claims to have resolved the bottlenecks in providing mobile users secure, easy-to-handle, and contact-free authorisation of transactions. The patent, which was filed in 2012 at the Delhi patent office, was granted to the e-commerce major on August 11, 2020, says a  report  by Financial Express. In the patent document, Amazon said that if a consumer uses the online payment option, they may have to add the biller details prior to making a transaction and stand in the queue to complete the transaction. This can cause potential security concerns as hackers or skimmers may scan the user device or cards for details. ""Similarly, if the person pre-authorises a biller, concerns may emerge of the biller conducting unauthorised payments. Amazon's invention addresses the aforementioned problems by providing a method for automatically authenticating a transaction based on the user’s location,"" the company said. With Amazon's patented method, the transaction can be authorised when the user's mobile is in close proximity to the merchant's location. According to Amazon, the method will also help in determining if the user has designated the merchant as a trusted merchant.

Despite being imported initially, India started producing these indigenously soon. Production was ramped up to the extent that most of the personal PPE kits distributed by the Centre were eventually indigenously produced. The Union Health Ministry stated on August 13 that its primary responsibility since COVID-19 outbreak has been to strengthen the health infrastructure of the country so that it is equipped to fight the pandemic. Indian industries were encouraged to produce and sell essential equipment such as masks, PPE kits, and ventilators since the outbreak of the disease.

Over 15 BJP leaders, including Union ministers for states (MoS) Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri, tweeted on August 12, urging people to join the party. Even as the BJP ramps up its activity to recruit more people into its fold, the TMC has been looking to bring back those who had left the party and has, in the past two weeks, managed to engineer some defections in some pockets, the report stated. For instance, on August 9, Baliram Ekka, who had unsuccessfully contested the Mal assembly seat for BJP, joined TMC along with his followers. He said he was unhappy with the BJP 'ever since he joined' and that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has done a ""lot for the welfare of local tea garden workers."" Jaidev Purkait, a former Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader from Canning in South 24 Parganas district, joined TMC along with some booth-level workers of BJP on the same day, the report said. Apart from these, two other BJP leaders— Sandip Ekka and Biswarup Ghosh— have also joined TMC in recent days. However, the saffron party's state leadership has said it is not giving any importance to these defections. ""TMC is desperate to project before the media that an erosion has started in the BJP before the elections. The fact is that none of these people are heavyweight leaders. Moreover, if 50 people are returning to the TMC, 500 are joining the BJP to replace them. Our numbers are growing by leaps and bounds,"" BJP's National Secretary Rahul Sinha said, adding that the leaders did not join TMC willingly, but because they faced 'threats and intimidation'.

The scheme will be implemented in five districts -- Mumbai suburban, Pune, Solapur, Palghar, and Amravati -- on a pilot basis,  Hindustan Times  reported. The state government has already invited applications from parents who would be interested in raising children for a limited time period. There are about 450 government institutes in Maharashtra that help raise orphaned children and children whose parents are unable to take care of them. The inmates of such childcare institutes are aged between 7 and 18 years. Manisha Birasis, who is the programme manager of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, said: “The basic principle of the Juvenile Justice Act is non-institutional parenting of children. Besides the adoption scheme, this is an opportunity for the children to live with unrelated families, albeit for a limited period. Their stay in the families will help them with their qualitative growth.” She informed that district-level committees have been formed to inspect the background of the families that will be applying for the foster care scheme. District women and child welfare officers, members of child welfare committee, child protection officers, and protection officers of non-institutional care will comprise the committee. These families will be monitored every 15 to 30 days via interactions with neighbours and the school principal. The child in foster care will be questioned too. Notably, children living in observation homes and those who are in conflict with the law will be excluded from the scheme for security reasons. Children aged zero to six years will also be excluded from the foster care scheme to ensure their prospects of permanent adoption are not hampered.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/i-t-department-aligns-e-assessment-scheme-with-faceless-assessment-5699341.html,I-T department aligns e-assessment scheme with faceless assessment,"The income tax department on Thursday amended its e-assessment scheme to align it with faceless assessment. Amending the e-assessment scheme launched last year, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) notified changes to include change in nomenclature of scheme from 'E-assessment scheme' to 'Faceless Assessment Scheme'. It also enhanced the scope of such faceless assessments to include 'best judgment assessments' in case a taxpayer is not cooperating with the tax authorities and advance intimation to a taxpayer that his assessment will be done under such 'Faceless Assessment Scheme'. 'Best judgement assessments' refer to tax assessments done as per the best of judgment of the tax officer, where the taxpayer does not co-operate or provide sufficient information for completion of assessment. Under the amended scheme, Principal Chief Commisioner of Income Tax/ Principal Director General of Income Tax in-charge of National E-assessment Centre (NeAC) has been empowered to transfer case to jurisdictional Assessing Officer (AO) at request of taxpayer or under specified circumstances, which require personal hearing. Also, powers have been granted to NeAC to either grant additional time to the taxpayer to furnish details or to forward its case for 'best judgment assessment'. The amended scheme says where the assessee fails to file response to the notice within the time specified in the notice or within the extended time, if any, NeAC shall intimate such failure to the assessment unit. The assessment unit shall, after taking into account all the relevant material, write a draft assessment order based on intimation received from NeAC to ""the best of its judgement"". Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said the most important aspect of new procedure, is coverage of 'best judgment assessment' in Faceless Assessment Scheme. Earlier, best judgment assessment in cases of non-cooperating taxpayers could be done only by jurisdictional AO. Kumar said jurisdictional AOs may sometime be familiar with taxpayers and contact/ convince them to cooperate with tax authorities to duly complete the assessment proceedings, especially in cases where taxpayers would miss the notices inadvertently.

Gadiwat village, located 25km from Aurangabad city, may not have access to good roads and other necessary infrastructure, but Internet connectivity has proven to be a boon for children studying at the local Zilla Parishad school. In September last year, the government-run school decided to launch a foreign language programme, under which students from Classes 4 to 8 were asked to choose a language they would like to learn. ""Surprisingly, most of them said they were interested in robotics and technology and were keen to learn Japanese,"" Dadasaheb Navpute, a secondary teacher at the school, told PTI. Despite having no proper course material and professional guidance for teaching Japanese, the school administration managed to gather information from videos and translation applications on the Internet, he said. However, the school has now roped in Sunil Jogdeo, an Aurangabad-based language expert, who has been conducting Japanese classes for free. On learning about the initiative, Jogdeo approached the school with a plan to conduct hour-long evening classes virtually. ""I have conducted 20 to 22 sessions since July. Children are dedicated and eager to learn. It is amazing how much they have picked up in this short span,"" Jogdeo said. Since every student does not have access to a smartphone for the online classes, the school has come up with the concept of 'vishay mitra' (subject friend), under which children who attend the sessions can teach their classmates. ""Ever since the online classes with Jogdeo started in July, children have been speaking with each other in Japanese,"" school headmaster Padmakar Huljute said with delight. The success of the programme is evident when Vaishnavi Kolge, daughter of a farmer-couple, rattles off complete sentences in Japanese to introduce herself.

The close below 11,200 washed out the gains of six sessions, suggesting that the Nifty might be in a distribution phase before this breakdown. If the index stays below 11,366, it can head towards 10,882 levels to complete one corrective structure of lower degree in terms of wave theory, he added.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/private-trains-bidders-raise-concerns-over-fares-train-timings-net-worth-norms-5683371.html,"Private trains: Bidders raise concerns over fares, train timings, net worth norms","Will they get to fix fares without regulatory approval? Will train timings, and stoppages between the origin and destination stations etc. be decided by them? And will the Indian Railways lower the net worth criterion needed to be eligible to bid for operating trains, in line with the criterion used for other infrastructure projects across the country? These are some of the overriding concerns of potential bidders for private trains. For the first time in 167 years of its existence, the Indian Railways has come up with a Request for Qualification (RFQ) document for allowing train operations by private players. On the anvil is granting cluster wise concession agreements for 151 such trains. Given the novelty of the exercise, it is no surprise that potential bidders for these clusters have asked questions on all possible subjects – a total of 222 queries - raging from operation of trains to mode of financing. The state-run transporter has initiated a two-stage bidding process to award 12 rail clusters to private operators. In the first pre-bid conference the Railways last month, there were a few public sector majors—at least one catering company, a domestic freight train operator, and a home-grown airport operator, besides some entities within the Railways' network. In short, many of those who showed up have little previous experience in operating trains. A large Indian conglomerate which operates ports and now airports, did not turn up despite showing interest in the process earlier. Another large business house also gave the conference a miss. Will the concerns seen through bidders’ queries deter some of them from eventually throwing their hats in the ring? This remains to be seen. Besides concerns over fares and net worth, the potential bidders appear to be worried over guidelines laid out in the RFQ document on how to fund the project once a bidder bags the concession; what happens after the 35-year concession period expires; will the concession period be extended further; what constitutes ‘O&M’ (operation and management) experience as listed in the document; and the fine print about who can bid for multiple train clusters. Fares:  The Indian Railways has said there will be no upper limit on fares for private train routes, no pre-approval would be needed from any regulatory authority before the private operator fixes fares for a route, and they will be completely market driven. The concession agreement defines gross revenue of the concessionaire to include amount printed on ticket fare, amount from preferred seat options, baggage/luggage, cargo/parcel (if not included in the ticket fare) and amount from on-board services such as catering, bed roll, content on demand, wi-fi (if not included in the ticket fare). The Railways has clarified in response to a query that the concessionaire can find other sources of revenue too, besides those listed above. So not only may a passenger be asked to pay for ‘ancillary’ services (just like airlines) like food, bedding and wi-fi, she may also be charged for other services that the train operator may want to monetise. There is no bar on revenue streams as long as the Railways gets a pre-determined share of the gross revenue earned by the concessionaire. Train timings:  The potential bidders have sought to double the time between a private train and a train operated by the Railways, but the state-run transporter doesn’t seem to agree. The condition stipulated in the RFQ states: No new similar scheduled train will depart the originating station in the same origin destination route within 60 minutes of the scheduled departure of the concessionaire’s train. One operator has sought “full flexibility” to schedule trains or schedule them within pre-defined time slots, since this would determine how many rakes needed for each cluster and this, in turn, would determine the investment needed. Optimum utilization of rakes would improve the gross revenue of the operator and thus raise the share due to the Railways. What after 35 years:  One bidder wanted to know if the current concession period of 35 years will be extended, and what happens once the first period expires? What happens to locomotives, rolling stock, and existing staff at the end of the concession period? The Railways has said upon the expiry of the concession period, the concessionaire would take back the trains. The construction and other works constructed/installed at the maintenance depot by the concessionaire would be transferred back to the Railways and there is no provision for extension of the concession period beyond 35 years. On another query about whether the premium quoted by a bidder shall be fixed throughout the concession period, the Railways has replied in the affirmative. The premium is the share of gross revenue that each bidder would be willing to offer to the Railways—bidders would be selected solely on the basis of highest revenue share. Net worth:  Two bidders pointed out that in other infrastructure projects in the country, the net worth requirement “hovers around 20 percent of the project cost. (e.g. Transmission TBCB projects). However, the proposed net worth requirement as per the RFQ is in the range of 50 percent of the project costs for all the clusters”. This respondent went on to add that additionally, a bid security of about 0.5 percent of the estimated project cost would also be collected and said such requirements “seem to be on the higher side. It is requested, hence, to review the net worth requirement and bid security amount and fix it at par with other infrastructure sectors"". But the Railways said no change in the net worth criterion was being contemplated as of now. Sindhu Bhattacharya is a Delhi-based journalist who writes on a range of topics in business and economy.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-banks-video-kyc-suit-expected-to-go-live-soon-5683301.html,HDFC Bank’s video KYC suite expected to go live soon,"HDFC Bank , the country’s largest private sector lender, is set to get on the video KYC bandwagon and could be going live with the service soon, according to two bankers in the know of the matter. This will allow the bank to onboard customers remotely, without the hassle of paperwork and physical branch visits. The Mumbai-based lender is already testing the platform, having started initial onboarding of customers, but it is yet to roll it out nationally, the sources said. Email queries sent to HDFC Bank are yet to elicit a response. Other private sector lenders, including ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and DCB Bank, have already gone live with their video KYC product. No physical presence Video KYC is a process through which customers can open a full-fledged savings or loan account without having to physically visit the branch or undertake any lengthy paperwork. The Reserve Bank of India greenlighted this process of onboarding customers in January, after which many lenders started going live. Banks are working with technology startups for remote document verification and video. Mumbai-based IDfy, Signzy and Veri5 Digital are some of the tech startups working with banks for this service. While HDFC Bank did not comment on the service provider it is working with, the sources cited above say it is working with IDfy. An email sent to IDfy remained unanswered. HDFC Bank is offering the service through its own website as well as through a dedicated app on the Play Store, called Insta Account. Currently it is offering a full-service savings and a salary account to begin with, but sources say it will be expanded across other services as well, including into credit cards, instant personal loans and others. “Currently the bank is still testing the platform, it has to be prepared for massive scale given its reach in the country,” said one of the sources mentioned above. How it works As a part of the onboarding journey, the banker said that customers will have to use their Aadhaar number and a PAN card to validate the application. On opting for the video call option, the customer will receive a link to a video call with a bank official. The official will capture a photo and get electronic signatures from the customer and validate the original documents digitally. “Accounts can be opened within minutes if the entire journey is undertaken smoothly,” the banker said. While a digital customer onboarding process has been in the works for months, video KYC has assumed significance because of the Covid-19 outbreak. With physical distancing the norm and consumers wary of stepping out, banks are relying on a fully digital onboarding process to add new customers. Ensuring safety during Covid-19 Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of the first to go live with video, back in May, had stated that digital delivery of services will become the norm because of the pandemic. During the launch of its own service, another private sector lender, DCB Bank, said the video KYC process reduces paperwork and also ensures safe customer onboarding during events such as a pandemic.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/view-accountability-and-transparency-need-of-the-hour-to-avert-another-plane-crash-5674941.html,View: Accountability and transparency need of the hour to avert another plane crash,"An air crash is not the result of a single event in isolation; it is a chain of events that lead to a disaster. This was seen during the two previous crashes in India – the 2010 air crash at Mangalore and the 2000 tragedy at Patna. As the focus shifts back to flight safety and airports in India with the recent crash of the Air India Express IX1344 at Kozhikode, it is important that we learn and act on past mistakes. The crash of Alliance Air B737-200 at Patna raised questions about the airport. The relatively shorter runway at the airport along with high temperatures in summer months make the airport risky. The most popular solution of runway extension is not feasible at Patna since it has a protected biological park at one end, and a major railway line at another! While most airports in the country have some or the other obstructions such as concrete structures on the approach path, in Patna there were trees that could grow to obstruct a landing and it required complex permissions to prune them. About eight years ago, the regulator had come up with a proposal to allow only turboprop flights in Patna, as a measure of flight safety. This idea did not move beyond the proposal stage and today Patna is one of the top airports in the country in terms of passenger traffic. Air Force Station Bihta – 30 kilometers from existing Patna airport -  will have a new civil enclave that will serve as a second airport for Patna. While this has been in the pipeline for last four years, it is far from reality as of today. Also, a second airport may take care of the traffic congestion at the older airport, but not the safety aspect. In 2010, IX-812 crashed in Mangalore. The table-top runway at Mangalore came in focus and so did many others. A recommendation to increase the runway length remains unheeded, without much being done since then. While Patna, Mangalore and Calicut are civil airports, things could be complex for air fields controlled by the armed forces. Airports like Pune, Goa, Jamnagar or Gwalior were primarily designed keeping in mind the needs of operating fighter jets. Thus, these airports have obstructions like a safety end, at the ends of their runways. For years, there has been demand to have another airport at Pune, Goa, Vizag or Patna but little has moved as the country battles challenges related to land acquisition and resettlement. There are multiple airports in the country which were classified as “airports which pose a safety risk”. Much has also been said and written about table top runways and while table top runways are not risky per say, the risk is higher in case of a runway excursion.  But little has been done. Need for transparency & continuity The Narendra Modi-led government in its second term now has put aviation in focus with ambitious schemes like RCS – UDAN. While the scheme's focus is to connect the unconnected and under-connected, the government has also been taking credit of the growth in air traffic and increase in commercial fleet even after the demise of Jet Airways. The government has also had its focus on transparency. The initial days saw the Prime Minister using technology to bring in transparency; right from having a dashboard of attendance at various departments being made public, to every department looking at ways to share real time information with the public. In the first term, when Jayant Sinha was Minister of State for Civil Aviation, a portal was launched to file and track complains – Air Sewa. There also was a mobile application and by the end of the term of the government, an enhanced version was also out. While Sinha was dropped from the second term, Air Sewa also disappeared! It speaks volumes about continuity and accountability – assuming that the portal and mobile application wasn’t developed for free. While it is common to see schemes being dropped when governments change, this became a case of dropping something that was being pushed on every occasion – just because the minister changed! Need for more accountability From every disaster, there has to be a learning and improvement – without which we could potentially be staring at another disaster. With the regulator DGCA revamping its website and the Civil Aviation Ministry also updating its regularly, it is time to have details on airports. For instance, what is the safety status of an airport, risk assessment and a time line towards improving anything highlighted as a risk. This has to be detailed out, with information on the  accountable manager, and responsibilities should be fixed in line with the citizen charter, to ensure a turnaround time is known and tracked. Pressure groups who work to attract airlines to their cities should also work towards ensuring that all safety measures are in place and efforts are undertaken to ensure safe operations at their favorite city’s airport.

Two bankers in the know told Moneycontrol that digital payment majors PhonePe and Google Pay are working with the NPCI to offer recurring payment mandates (autopay) to their users.

Looking to get a toehold in a market dominated by the likes of Adidas, PUMA, and Nike, the brand is looking to capitalise on the passion for sports and fitness of young Indians who are wary about the products they use. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Tushar Goculdas, Managing Director, Under Armour India, shares how the brand is looking to tackle the impact of COVID-19 and the way ahead in an extremely competitive market. Edited excerpts: Q: How is Under Armour India dealing with the COVID-19 upheavals? A:  First and foremost, we are doing our best to take care of each person associated with our brand and business – our employees as well as our various business partners and their teams, especially the frontline teams in our stores and warehouse. We are also focusing our energies on identifying opportunities for growth and improvement and driving initiatives that will create impact both in the short and long term. An important growth opportunity pertains to our retail stores footprint. We are already well-placed in Delhi-NCR with five stores in top locations and ready to open our sixth store at Pacific Mall in a couple of months. We are really excited to finally enter Mumbai, with the launch of our flagship store at High Street Phoenix at the end of August, followed by Infinity Mall, Malad, at the end of September. Beyond Mumbai, we have a strong pipeline of new stores opening this year in Lucknow, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad. We are also exploring top retail locations to expand our presence in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and in new markets including Kolkata, Kochi, Nagpur, Jaipur, Coimbatore, and Punjab. In addition to the retail expansion, we are working on new and emerging business models such as store to home and omni-channel. We are also exploring new business partnerships to help us leverage these opportunities. With health and fitness emerging as top priorities for our consumers, we have developed deeper connections with our consumers through our frontline teams, social media channels, and e-commerce partners. Via social media, we continue to support athletes and fitness enthusiasts with our premium performance-enhancing products and engaging at-home fitness content. We are upskilling our frontline teams to further strengthen our service to customers – in person and over the phone. Q: What kind of impact are you expecting on the revenue front from India operations? A:  The two months of lockdown when all non-essential services were shut, did impact our business, like any other. However, once the government announced guidelines for the reopening of non-essential e-commerce and retail, we saw steadily growing demand. Our e-commerce partners have achieved strong sales since restarting business in end-May and are now surpassing pre-COVID levels. Six of our 10 retail stores have been operating since early June and are performing much better than our expectations. We also have a strong pipeline of 10 new stores that should open by the end of the year. This is a testament to the trust and engagement our customers have in our innovative and technology-driven premium performance wear products. While we may be unable to recover the revenue loss during lockdown months, we are confident of ending the year strong and well prepared for strong growth in 2021. Q: Will Under Armour India look to tie up with Indian domestic teams and are there any plans for the grassroots level? A:  Under Armour is a premier athletic performance wear brand that inspires athletes from around the world, from everyday performers to champions across various sports. To connect with our core audience, we are engaging with a number of athletes at the grassroots level. Our partnership with the Indian Women's Ice-Hockey team is the perfect example of our commitment to supporting athletes with world-class gear and equipment, to help them perform better and make the nation proud. Our focus will remain on identifying, encouraging, and celebrating such unsung stories and emerging sports and athletes from across the country in the years to come. Q: When is Under Armour looking for sales to pick up? A:  Our consumers are now even more focused. They are giving more time to fitness activities. This has created a stronger demand for our premium performance-enhancing products. Sales through our retail outlets are also steadily bouncing back as we are witnessing brand fans and loyalists walking in to shop for our world-class products. Around 60 percent of our retail stores have been operating since early June and are now reaching pre-COVID levels of business. Q: What are the key takeaways from the COVID-19 crisis at Under Armour India? A:  The pandemic has clearly shifted the way both companies and consumers behave and act. From an organisation perspective, it has put a clear focus on people and their welfare. At Under Armour India we have been careful to focus on the well-being of our people and associates, not just financially and from a career perspective, but also emotionally as well as psychologically. The other big lesson is the forced experiment of working from home. The lockdown proved that work from home only impacts efficiency but not effectiveness. Business does get done through virtual meetings and the need for in-person connections and travel will now not be the first resort. In addition, we see a deep and long-lasting change in mindset and consumer behaviour with an increased focus on health and fitness. This would lead to a greater appreciation and demand for high-quality athletic performance products and is an opportunity for us as a business. Q: Will there be any addition to celebrities as brand ambassadors? A:  As a brand, we have always supported sports and fitness authenticators and are on a constant lookout for athletes who have an unmatched passion and dedication to constantly better their performance. We are looking to onboard athletes who will add value to the brand and share the same values and ethos. We do not limit our options to popular and mainstream sports but look for passionate athletes, fitness enthusiasts and unsung heroes who we can support in their journey.

The trial is in partnership with ICMR. We will start manufacturing vaccines by the end of August,"" Poonawalla said. On August 7, the Serum Institute of India had  announced  the partnership with Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to accelerate the manufacture and delivery of up to 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, via its Strategic Investment Fund, will provide at-risk funding of $150 million to Gavi, which will be used to support the Serum Institute of India to manufacture potential vaccine candidates, and for future procurement of vaccines for low- and middle-income countries via Gavi’s COVAX AMC.

Promoters Baring Asia PE, who announced their intent to de-list in June, can now push the proposal forward. Earlier, the company board had approved the de-listing. Of the 1,197 shareholders who voted, 705, including promoters, voted in favour of the de-listing. Of this, public shareholder votes accounted about 7.3 crore. Close to 492 shareholders with 56 lakh votes were tendered against the proposal. According to a filing in the Bombay Stock Exchange, the resolution for de-listing has been passed since the number of votes in favour is three times more than those that voted against it. “In terms of Regulation 8(1) (b) of the Delisting Regulations, the Special Resolution will be considered to have been passed only if the votes cast by public shareholders in favour of the proposal amount to at least two times the number of votes cast by public shareholders against it (requisite majority),"" the scrutiniser’s report explained. The scrutiniser’s report said the resolution is considered passed since it has the requisite majority. Now that the de-listing is happening, it is unlikely to change operations. In a recent  interaction  with Moneycontrol, R Srikrishna said the de-listing would have no impact on its operations or employees and clients. He added that clients have so far raised no concerns over the move, and there are no issues on retaining employees either. “The whole idea is to continue as it is,” he stated. Employee compensation is not likely to be an issue as well. In an earnings call on July 28, he said if the de-listing goes through, employees with company stocks would be adequately compensated. This could be through ownership plans similar to restricted stock units (RSU), he said. RSU is a compensation issued to employees in the form of company shares.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/amazon-prime-membership-doubles-during-prime-day-2020-from-last-year-5677411.html,Amazon Prime membership doubles during Prime Day 2020 from last year,"US-based e-tailer Amazon's 48-hour long festive sale event saw double the number of customers signing up for Prime membership as compared to the year before. The Prime Day sales were held on August 6 and 7. The company did not disclose the number of subscribers. All it said was over 65 percent new members came from outside the top 10 cities in the country. Personal computing devices, large appliances, kitchenware, smartphones, apparel and pantry items were among the hot sellers. Work-from- home purchase trends continued, with customers buying laptops, printers, monitors and the like. The event, which gave multiple sellers an opportunity to sell their piled- up inventory following the lockouts and the pandemic, turned out to be promising for the e-commerce giant. Prime Day sales are conducted every year as a global in July. Owing to COVID-19, Amazon postponed the event in the US but went ahead with it in India. The company's flagship event, The Great Indian Festival, is likely to be held in October, ahead of Diwali and Dussehra. The rise in the Prime subscriptions has not only bolstered the revenue of the company but has secured a promising set of customers who will be on the look-out for big offers during the upcoming sale season. Amazon claims that during the two-day sale, more than four out of five prime members were engaged with at least one of the five categories -- shopping, video, music, reading and gaming. Rival Flipkart also ran its five-day sale -- Big Saving Days -- starting August 6. However, it didn't share any detail about the event. Multiple sellers Moneycontrol spoke to said that their sales saw unprecedented growth – five to six times a regular day. A seller, requesting anonymity, said that earlier he used to sell only the excess or unsold inventory in marketplaces. However, given the lack of offline sale avenues this year due to the pandemic, he, like with many others, relied solely on the e-commerce channels. Complaints about delivery mechanism  Many sellers, however, complained about the delay in pick-up dates, which was possibly caused by broken supply chain, reduced manpower and many warehouses falling within the containment zones. An apparel seller from Ludhiana shared a screenshot wherein his pick- up was scheduled for August 29 for a purchase which happened during the sale weekend. Sellers were crying foul as this not just delays the delivery of the product but also payments. “Barriers have been created so that sellers are forced to use logistic services of the marketplace. The idea is to cannibalise the marketplace and create an artificial notion that Cloudtail and Appario are better and they deliver goods faster,” said the spokesperson of the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA). Cloudtail and Appario are the preferred vendors of Amazon in whose holding entities the US giant has stakes in. Meanwhile, Amazon claimed it saw the highest even participation from small and medium business, with over 91,000 of them, including artisans and weavers. More than 62,000 sellers were from non-metros and Tier II and III cities. ",companies,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 12:31 AM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/lupin-first-company-to-shift-manufacturing-of-some-drugs-from-india-to-us-after-trumps-buy-american-order-5677001.html,Lupin first company to shift manufacturing of some drugs from India to US after Trump’s ‘Buy American’ order,"Lupin  has started shifting the manufacture of some drugs from India to the US, following the US government's policy of 'Buy American', directing federal agencies to give priority to drugs made in US factories, CEO Vinita Gupta told  Moneycontrol  during an interview. US President Donald Trump had last week signed an executive order directing federal agencies to buy certain essential medicines solely from US factories. Lupin is the first pharma company to do so after Trump’s order. Gupta did not name the drugs or categories that have been shifted. Analysts said Lupin’s move does not have much effect on the Indian pharma sector as Trump’s order mainly applies to public procurement by US departments and state agencies. “Our supplies/exports are mainly to the non-government sector,  dominated by supply chain cartels like Walmart, and much export to state agencies or departments doesn't happen.  Also, US doesn't encourage Indian manufacturers to participate in public procurement processes and mainly involve companies in the US and EU,” Dinesh Dua, Chairman, Pharmaceuticals ExportPromotion Council of India (Pharmexcil), said. Pharmexcil is a trade body under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Surya Patra, Vice President, PhillipCapital, echoed the view: “Too early days, and are not expecting any major changes the way pharma companies operate."" US business Lupin, Gupta said, is banking on the approval of its generic drug Albuterol, relaunch of Metformin, and the scale-up of Levothyroxine to help recover its US business in the second quarter of FY21. Albuterol sulfate or generic ProAir HFA is an inhaler-based drug used for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases. Metformin is used as a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Levothyroxine is used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency. “Based on the market improvement that we’ve seen in the last two months, we expect things to improve. The baseline business is getting normalised,"" Gupta said. “Efforts are under way to bring Metformin back into the market within the quarter. After that, we plan to ramp up material products like synthetic hormonal drug Levothyroxine and Albuterol that we have to launch this quarter. We also have a couple of other partner products that we are expecting this quarter. All these give us the confidence to improve the topline and margins from Q2 onwards,"" Gupta said. Albuterol sales are worth around $800 million- $1 billion in the US alone. Lupin is targeting a 20 percent market share for the drug. The company plans to launch another limited-competition inhalation product, generic Fostair, in 2020. Lupin's respiratory products, including its inhalers, are developed at its Inhalation Research Center at Coral Springs, Florida. Gupta, who is based in the US, runs the critical US business that contributes little over one-third of Lupin's revenues. The US business was down 26 percent in Q1FY21 on a quarter on quarter (Q-o-Q) basis due to the seasonality of flu products such as Oseltamivir and Azithromycin. The pre-buying in March and the recall of Metformin extended-release (ER) tablets in the US market due to the presence of a probable cancer causing impurity, N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) also affected revenues. Revenues in Q1FY21 dropped 9.1 percent on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis to Rs 3,528 crore. The company posted a net profit of Rs 106.9 crore during Q1FY21, a drop of 60 percent on a Y-o-Y basis. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins dropped 530 basis points Y-o-Y 14.7 percent to Rs 5,085 crore. Regulatory update Gupta said the company is expecting the US Food and Drug Administration’s (USFDA) inspection of the company’s Somerset facility in New Jersey in a couple of months. “Due to COVID-19, the USFDA has not been travelling for inspections. They have announced that at the end of July, they will start on-site inspections in the US. So we have offered Somerset for inspection and expect it to happen in the next couple of months,"" Gupta said. Five manufacturing plants, including four in India, are under USFDA scanner. They include Indore Unit-2 (which makes oral solid and ophthalmic formulations), Goa (oral solids), Mandideep Unit-1 (cephlosporins), Somerset (oral, derma and controlled substances), and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing site in Tarapur, Maharashtra. All five have been classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI) by the USFDA. The warning letters and OAI bar them from getting new approvals. There is some uncertainty around the inspection of Indian facilities as the USFDA is focusing on inspections related to COVID-19 vaccines and products now, Gupta said. “We’re still trying to get clarity from the agency. We have made tremendous progress on (the resolution of) the Goa and the Pithampur units. In fact, in the last couple of months, we had a successful inspection of the Pithampur unit by the UK drug regulator MHRA,"" Gupta said.

The company logged a net profit of Rs 360.64 crore in the same quarter last fiscal, Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd (MSSL) said in a regulatory filing. Total revenue from operations during the quarter under review stood at Rs 8,503.89 crore. It was at Rs 16,792.53 crore in the year-ago period. ""The group's operations and consolidated financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 have been adversely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown announced by governments in many of the jurisdictions, the group operates, due to which the operations were suspended for a large part of the quarter and resumed only gradually with prescribed regulations and precautions,"" MSSL said. The consolidated financial results for June quarter are therefore not comparable with those of previous periods, it added. The group has been taking several measures to address the operational challenges, including availing of benefits under the various government support schemes announced in the respective countries, it said. Commenting on the performance during the quarter, MSSL COO Pankaj Mital said in April and May, there were really no production in the company's biggest geographies -- Europe and North American regions. ""There has been an impact there because that's where the largest volume of business is happening,"" Mital told PTI. Even in India, there was no commercial activity or very little commercial activity in April and May, he said, adding that plants in some countries such as China, the UAE and Thailand however continued to operate during the quarter. Mital said the company is gradually ramping up production globally with 84 per cent of the plants running at more than 50 per cent capacity as of July 24 with many countries coming back to normalcy from COVID-19 induced lockdowns. MSSL Chairman Vivek Chaand Sehgal said: ""(The) coronavirus pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the global automotive industry. Lockdown in various parts of the world severely dented demand for automobile sector in the first quarter of the fiscal."" He said that the company's topmost concern and focus during this period were the wellbeing and safety of MSSL employees across all the plant locations and that it worked on a war footing to put robust safety protocols in place. Even though the first quarter was a washout, he said, economies have started witnessing green shoots of recovery. ""Our teams and plants across the globe have also resumed operations and are working closely with our customers to fulfil their requirements. We now expect demand for the auto industry to gain momentum in the coming quarters of this fiscal year,"" Sehgal said. On the outlook, Mital said the situation is getting better.

GPX India has a fibre-connected campus in Mumbai with two datacentres and the deal is expected to close by March 2021 after mandatory approvals. It can be noted that interest in the datacentres space has been going up over the last few years in India, with investments or big commitments being made.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/indian-hotels-company-scouts-for-partner-to-help-build-new-hotel-on-sea-rock-land-5685401.html,Indian Hotels Company scouts for partner to help build new hotel on Sea Rock land,"Indian Hotels Company  (IHCL) intends to bring in a partner to invest in a new hotel that will rise on the Sea Rock land in Mumbai. The Tata Group firm will assume charge of the property under a management contract signed with the partner. In July, IHCL, which runs luxury properties under the Taj and Vivanta brands, signed a binding agreement for the acquisition of a 14.28 percent stake from ELEL Hotels, paving the way for 100 percent ownership of the holding company, which has a 60-year lease on the Sea Rock land. IHCL owns the Sea Rock leasehold till 2069, as per a disclosure by the company in its Q1FY21 presentation. Considering it will require at least a year to seek all the required clearances and another 3-4 years to build the property, one-fourth of the lease period, which commenced in 2009, would be lost. IHCL’s strategy Speaking to analysts after IHCL declared its June quarter results, Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director and CEO of IHCL, said: “The Sea Rock and the Lands End (across the road from Sea Rock) will be the next icons for Mumbai, just like the Taj Mahal Colaba. The only question which we would debate or which would not be our choice at this point in time is to use our own capital,” “Our strategy will be to use some partner to help us build it and we will manage it. That’s what we have been doing. A majority of our hotels in the pipeline are based on that model. We will set the design and planning of it in the foreseeable future — and I mean 12-18 months. We can break ground and start rolling after getting all the permissions,” added Chhatwal. Given the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, IHCL wants to avoid burdening its balance sheet further. At a consolidated level, the chain’s net debt had jumped 22 percent to Rs 2,328 crore by the end of the June quarter as against Rs 1,915 crore at the end of the March quarter. During Q1 IHCL raised Rs 500 crore of long-term debt. Tough quarter IHCL posted a net loss of Rs 313 crore for the quarter ended June as against a profit of Rs 5 crore in the same period last year. In all, 14,000 rooms of the company had become operational and about 5,000-6,000 remained shut by the end of July, as per company disclosures. Occupancy rates across India by the end of June settled at 21 percent, which is a 67 percent decline from last June. Revenue per available room (RevPar) was down 81 percent to Rs 652, as per data shared by HVS Anarock Hotels & Hospitality Review. IHCL did not disclose the acquisition price for the 14.28 percent stake held by the Nanda family-controlled ELEL Hotels in the Sea Rock holding company. However, a disclosure in the hotel chain’s 2019-20 annual report said that it would pay Rs 250 crore for the deal. This values the property at over Rs 1,666 crore, which is more than double the Rs 800-crore valuation it got in 2009 when IHCL bought the initial stake. The  Mumbai-headquartered company is also fighting a public interest litigation  (PIL) over the use of floor space index (FSI) for the Sea Rock property. Environmental clearance is also awaited for the project. The combined inventory strength (Taj Lands End + the new hotel on Sea Rock land) would be at least 1,000 rooms, multiple ballrooms, event spaces and convention centres. Chequered history Sea Rock, originally  built by the Luthria brothers through ELEL Hotels  and Investment Limited (EHIL), opened in 1978 in collaboration with the Welcomegroup of the ITC chain. In the 1980s, it tied up with the prestigious Sheraton and was known as the Welcomegroup SeaRock Sheraton. It was the favourite haunt of film stars and airline crew. A banquet hall, business centre and executive lounge gave it the tag of a business hotel, as well. ",companies,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 12:02 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

""Currently the demand is huge for remdesivir, and we are scaling up our internal manufacturing of Remdesivir,"" Kedar Upadhye, global chief financial officer of Cipla, told Moneycontrol. Upadhye did not specify the new capacity that will be added, but hinted that over a period of time, the company wants to move remdesivir production in-house. Cipla has partnered with BDR Pharmaceuticals for API supplies and Sovereign Pharma for finished dosages. Sovereign Pharma has the capacity to produce up to 95,000 vials per month. Cipla launched remdesivir under brand name Cipremi at Rs 4,000 per vial in July. Cipremi is the cheapest of all generic versions of remdesivir available in the market. A patient needs five vials of the drug. Cipla is among the six Indian generic pharma manufacturers that have signed non-exclusive voluntary licencing agreements with Gilead Sciences for its patented drug Veklury (remdesivir). Moneycontrol  reported  that 800,000 doses of remdesivir are expected to be available in the country in August as existing suppliers expand capacity, and new manufacturers get ready to enter the market with their generic versions. Tocilizumab shortages Besides remdesivir, another drug tocilizumab that Cipla markets under licensing pact with Swiss pharma company Roche is also seeing huge demand, leading to shortage of the drug in the market. ""For tocilizumab, unfortunately we are not able to do anything. But we are in touch with them (Roche) to ease supplies,"" said Upadhye. Upadhye further said nobody was prepared for this kind of bump up in demand, and it is difficult for them to increase the capacity. Upadhye said the company has the broadest range of drugs and products for COVID-19, from face masks to sanitizers and drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, vitamins, among others.

The management said the rights issue received a strong response from shareholders, with the issue oversubscription 2.24 times. When a company issues rights shares, it offers existing shareholders a chance to purchase additional equity at a discounted price. PVR's rights issue, which had closed on July 31, garnered Rs 672 crore for 85 lakh shares. The offer size was Rs 300 crore, or about 38 lakh shares, at an issue price of Rs 784. Talking to Moneycontrol, Nitin Sood, CFO, PVR, said, “The proceeds will be essentially used for meeting working capital needs (like cinema maintenance, electricity) and partly for debt repayment obligations. We have approximately Rs 150 crore of debt repayments due in FY21."" Analysts tracking the stock feel PVR will need capital to fund rental and other expenses once the Centre allows cinemas to open as occupancy will remain low initially. Karan Taurani, Vice President, Elara Capital, estimates a cash burn of Rs 30-40 crore during the lockdown period for PVR and expects this to rise to Rs 60-70 crore when theatres reopen. Theatres in India have been shut for over five months due to coronavirus-led lockdown. While cinemas were expected to open in Unlock 3.0, there has been no government order on their resumption. While theatres still remain shut, PVR has prepared itself to welcome the audience back to theatres. It has invested Rs 6 crore across its properties on safety and hygiene measures. On whether the sanitisation measure will make a dent in its business, especially after theatres restart operations, Sood said the investments that it will be making on new safety protocols after restarting will not be so significant that it will impact the business negatively. However, when it comes to occupancy, which is likely to be 30 percent to adhere to social distancing norms, Sood feels the “first four to 12 weeks will be difficult. We see much lower occupancy in FY21 as compared to last year. It will take three-to-four months before occupancy starts returning. But with new films coming in from Diwali, I think the audience should start coming back.” In FY20, PVR had not only crossed the 10 crore footfall mark, but had also made record screen additions by crossing the 800-screen target. On the overall film business, Taurani said the performance was healthy in pre-COVID times backed by good content. ""We were about to end FY20 with highest ever Hindi box office growth of 16 percent until COVID hit in March. In coming months, occupancy will be a challenge and we expect some respite only during Diwali if larger films like  Sooryavanshi  and  83  are launched,"" he added.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-craft-brewer-bira-in-talks-with-foreign-beer-makers-over-possible-stake-sale-5684511.html,Indian craft brewer Bira in talks with foreign beer makers over possible stake sale,"India's B9 Beverages, maker of popular craft beer Bira, is in talks with international brewers and investors to sell a stake of up to 20 percent in the company, its chief executive told Reuters on August 11. ""We've been looking for a combination: (an) international beer company as a strategic investor and a separate financial partner,"" CEO Ankur Jain said in a phone interview, adding that the company was in the ""intermediate stage"" of raising funds. ""We've been talking to beer companies that are not competitive in India or have minimal operations in India."" Data provider PitchBook estimates New Delhi-based Bira was valued at $210 million in 2018. US-based Sequoia Capital holds a roughly 45 percent stake in the company, while CEO Jain and his family own around 30 percent. Jain declined to name the companies with which it is in talks, but four industry sources said Bira had been in talks with Kirin Holdings, one of Japan's biggest beer makers which has limited sales in India. A Kirin spokesman said there was ""absolutely no discussion at the moment"" on taking a stake in Bira. Last week Kirin cut its full-year profit outlook due to the COVID-19 impact and said it would avoid ""non-essential"" investments. A Kirin source said the company sees India as a growth market and that it has looked at Bira, but that it was part of a broader study into global markets. One of the Indian industry sources said that Bira and Kirin had discussed a deal which would also allow the Japanese brewer to offer its brands directly - which include Kirin Lager and Ichiban Shibori - in India's estimated $7 billion beer market. Kirin has in the past shown interest in independent breweries and owns a minority stake in New York's Brooklyn Brewery. Bira, launched in 2015, is one of the smallest players in India, but its craft beer offerings have become increasingly popular. Jain said Bira had a 5-10% share of the beer market in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. India's beer market is dominated by companies like United Breweries, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Carlsberg, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. FINANCIAL LOSSES, IPO An investment from Kirin or other investors would help Bira which has made losses in recent years and been hit by the coronavirus pandemic, just like the rest of the beer industry. It has said it aims eventually to list on the stock market. ""Bira is really struggling financially at the moment and they badly need a lifeline. A deal with Kirin or any of the other global strategic companies would give them that,"" said one of the Indian industry sources. Bira clocked $24.5 million in sales in the fiscal year ending March 2019, 15 percent higher than the previous year, but its net loss for the period doubled to $27 million. Results for the year through March 2020 have not yet been released but CEO Jain said sales grew by 40 percent in that fiscal year and that the company's results in recent years were in line with its growth plans.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/covid-19-impact-cfos-choices-in-steering-companies-to-ride-the-new-normal-5687561.html,COVID-19 impact | CFO's choices in steering companies to ride the new normal,"A recent survey of CFOs conducted by a global consulting firm revealed that half the CFOs were cautiously optimistic about the outlook in July than they were in April. Most were working on optimising working capital, streamlining performance management and of course, the quintessential enterprise-wide cost reduction initiatives. This is the time for a CFO to strike a fine balance as the role would involve building agility and resilience in the short term while readying the organisation to lead the growth in the new normal. Given below are a few of the points they need to keep in mind to emerge as a leader in current times and beyond. Growth and profitability Growth and profitability are two important levers for any company. In the current, constrained market, the urge to demonstrate revenue growth needs to be balanced with the use of discerning lens on how those orders pan out to fructify profits. While this provides an opportunity, the responsibility rests largely with the CFOs and the finance function to ensure that margins are protected Profit over volumes has always been our mantra for quality growth. Various empirical research has shown that companies that plan for growth in a downturn always benefit when the markets revive. Currently, companies focused on industrial sectors that are expected to come back to growth sooner will be the ones to ride ahead in the new normal. Resilience for the present and preparedness for the future CFOs and the finance function everywhere are struggling to build organisational resilience to navigate the present situation. It is very important for any organisation to plan with an outlook of the future of a new normal. Tackling the present involves activities such as measures to improve the liquidity situation, consistent and transparent communication with stakeholders, high levels of governance and the critical activity of planning through future scenarios. While not letting go of the reins in cost control or liquidity measures, it is important through scenario planning to decide on the new parameters for leadership to plan for the new normal. This is where a lot of predictive tools can be deployed for real-time visibility to financial analysis and planning.  To build the preparedness for the future, this visibility would help build a dashboard of desired matrices for the leadership to help plan those moves for the future. Cash as culture or revenue-focused delivery of organisations Cash is no longer the king but the emperor in current times. There is a saying that goes that if you are looking for cash, look within. There are many obvious areas like receivables, inventory, sound working capital practices, capital expenditure plans, which are the usual areas when companies relook at cash practices. The difference lies in making it a culture at multiple levels or making it about reshaping certain processes and policies for reactive one-time gains. When it comes to making it a culture, sometimes it could be as simple as motivating the sales force on the one hand and on the other, treating suppliers as partners with a strategy to balance both.  Similarly, while being revenue-focused is important as maintaining targets of business growth are critical, it is also paramount to balance the health of the business in terms of margins, profits, cash, etc. So, bigger is not necessarily better. Especially in current times where topline has been significantly eroded for most companies, the inclination would be to focus on recovering it at a significant pace, if markets permit. There is a delicate balance as to when to cut margins to generate more sales, make an adjustment to credit terms to increase customers, in other words, do what is required to grow the business. It is important to create a conducive enterprise-wide atmosphere where people at all levels are having value conversations, where potential is not limited only to improving benchmarks or performance sustained at the cost of company balance sheets. Cost reductions or spending wisely in early investments as recovery starts A lot of research conducted during the earlier financial downturn has demonstrated that companies which emerged stronger are the ones that had prepared in advance for the recovery and the changed the normal. So, cost reduction programs could also be about spending wisely. Organisations are using this time also to invest in deepening their customer relationships – in transporting the customer to a different arena, capitalising on digital services, remote commissioning, troubleshooting and other services, innovative packaged offerings for greater value, etc. Such times bring about the opportunity for us to rethink our cost structures and the way we conduct our business, among other things. It is therefore important that any plan-ahead teams are supported by early investments be it in customer engagement, adaptive operations and fueling innovations as the recovery sets in. People make the difference Without a doubt, the statement that organisations are made of people is the key to ushering in the transformation within the organisation. Reprioritising and making some quick moves on certain policies that help people reskill to adapt to the changing needs also apply to the finance function.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/fmcg-q1-review-the-quarter-of-health-and-hygiene-products-5691431.html,FMCG Q1 Review: The quarter of health and hygiene products,"The coronavirus pandemic has completely changed life as we know it. The fear of catching the infection has also led us to adopt a more healthy and hygienic lifestyle. The shift in trend clearly reflected in the first-quarter performance of FMCG  companies such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever,  Marico, Dabur, and Britannia. With health & hygiene categories in focus, discretionary categories were on the slow lane. The other theme that showed promise for Indian FMCG players was rural demand. The rabi harvest was good, Kharif sowing was off to a great start, rural cash flows were looking up and the pandemic did not wreak havoc in the rural areas. This optimism was reflected in the earnings of FMCG companies who also benefitted from benign raw material prices. In terms of food items, there was a rising trend of ‘at-home’ as opposed to ‘out-of-home’ consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase. Which products saw the highest demand? India’s FMCG major, ITC witnessed the demand for staples, noodles, biscuits, dairy, sanitisers, hand wash, and floor cleaners. On the other hand, discretionary categories and those with relatively higher salience of ‘out-of-home’ consumption witnessed contraction. The 'B Natural' range of juices particularly immunity range was met with encouraging response from discerning consumers. Similarly, Hindustan Unilever saw the highest demand during the lockdown for coffee, sanitisers, deep cleaning, and Kissan products. HUL offers a prominent coffee brand, BRU, while sauces and jams fall under the brand Kissan. Within deep cleaning, HUL offers products such as Domex under the home care category and Lifebuoy under skincare category. Skin Cleansing led by Lifebuoy delivered strong double-digit growth across formats. Within the food and refreshment category, riding on the in-home and wellness and immunity trends, tea and coffee registered double-digit growth indicating robust demand. On the other hand, demand for ice creams, skin, colour cosmetics, deodorant were impacted due to supply-led issues and closure of some of the channels that were extremely relevant for the categories The company has divided its portfolio into three categories-Health, Nutrition, and Hygiene which constitutes 80 percent of the portfolio delivered healthy mid-single-digit domestic consumer growth. For Marico, Saffola Edible Oils continued its growth journey, posted 16 percent volume growth, building on strong brand credentials, ramped-up presence, and increased in-home consumption. Parachute, their flagship product, remained on a firm footing as lockdown restrictions eased in May and June. The volume market share of the Coconut Oil franchise which includes Nihar Naturals and Oil of Malabar strengthened by about 180bps to 62 percent. Nihar Shanti Amla Badam led the recovery in May and June, while among the newer introductions, Parachute Advansed Aloe Vera Enriched Coconut Hair Oil witnessed encouraging trends in June. Dabur witnessed the demand for Immunity boosting products such as Dabur Chyawanprash and Dabur Honey along with new launches in the hygiene space such as Dabur sanitiser, Dabur veggie wash, Dazzl surface cleaner, Dabur Sanitize disinfectant spray, Dabur Tulsi Drops. COVID-19 environment helped the consumption of packaged food. Britannia saw demand for biscuits which is their mainstay business as 70-80 percent of revenue comes from biscuits. Britannia sells biscuits such as Good Day in 9 variants, 50-50 in four variants, nutrichoice in nine variants.

Mistry further said that RBI’s one-time restructuring was necessary given how many industries were affected by the COVID-19. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mistry also talked about HDFC successfully raising Rs 10,000 crore via equity issuance as well as raising just over Rs 300 crore upfront via a warrant issue. In addition to RBI, liquidity and interest rates, Mistry also shared his views about demand outlook in the future and other issues.

In terms of liquidity, he said, “Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done a very commendable job in terms of maintaining liquidity in the system. There was a lot of tightness in liquidity in the latter part of March and early April but since then RBI has been very liberal in terms of ensuring that there is enough liquidity in the market and the liquidity reaches even the weaker segments of the markets,"" ""So hats off to RBI, it is a great job. My sense is liquidity will remain more or less at these levels, I don’t see interest rates coming down very sharply in the short-term at least because we have some fear of inflationary pickup and there is adequate liquidity in the system. So my sense is these rates will remain at these levels at least for some time,"" Mistry added. When asked about one-time restructuring, he replied, ""Restructuring was necessary not just for real estate because there are so many industries that have been impacted because of COVID – hotels, airlines, hospitality and of course real estate.

The vaccine has been named  Sputnik V, in honour of another world first, the Sputnik satellite  launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, during the Cold War. Full-scale production of the vaccine is  expected to begin in September . It is being developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, the Defence Ministry and the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund. To be sure, the green light didn't come as surprise, as Russian officials have been hinting at possible approval of the vaccine for the past few weeks. What exactly is Sputnik V? The Sputnik V vaccine comes under a category of non-replicating viral vectors. A vector, in this instance, is a weakened virus that transports pieces of disease-causing pathogen in an attempt to stimulate an immune response. Sputnik V is based on a modified human adenovirus as vector, which carries the protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Adenoviruses are benign and relatively easier to engineer, and have therefore become very popular as vectors. However, not a single vaccine has been approved until now for commercial use involving this vector. There are several potential vaccines now being developed using adenoviruses, including the leading candidates by  Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, China’s CanSino Biologics and Johnson & Johnson. In Sputnik's case, the infection-causing gene in the adenovirus is knocked off, and the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein gene is inserted. Once re-engineered, the adenovirus is given to the body, and generates an immune response. The vaccine has to be given in two doses, with a gap of 21 days. Interestingly, the Russians used two types of human adenoviruses (rAd26 and rAd5) for the first and second vaccination, to boost the effect of the vaccine. China’s CanSino Biologics (Ad5) and Oxford University-AstraZeneca's Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) have used a single variant adenovirus. How safe is the vaccine? According to the WHO, the vaccine is in phase-1 clinical trials, with 76 participants. The Russian government, however, says phase-1 and phase 2 clinical trials were completed on August 1. It says that all the volunteers are feeling well, and no unforeseen or unwanted side effects have been observed. It also claims that the vaccine induced a strong antibody and cellular immune response. “Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with Covid-19 after being administered with the vaccine,” claims the official website of the Russian vaccine. Russian official sources say that the vaccine will begin phase-3 clinical trials involving more than 2,000 people in Russia, and a number of Middle Eastern countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and Latin American countries, including Brazil and Mexico. Russian officials say that India, too, has shown interest in becoming part of the phase-3 trial. Mass production of the vaccine is expected to start next month. What are the concerns over Sputnik V? Russia is taking an enormous risk by going ahead with a vaccine that has not been tested rigorously on humans to ascertain its safety and efficacy.  Vaccines, unlike drugs, are given to healthy individuals across age groups and gender. Gamaleya is yet to publish results from human trials, or preclinical studies that involve testing on animals in any peer-reviewed journal. So, there isn't much data available on the vaccine's safety, efficacy and dosage. Experts say that Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials are too small to establish safety and efficacy. Conventionally regulators take a call on approving a vaccine following phase-3. Typically, phase-3 is conducted on 20,000-40,000 people, to find out whether the vaccine candidate can stop people from getting Covid-19 in the real world and how long the protection lasts. It takes years to get this information in a natural setting, though the process can be sped up by using human challenge trials — where a vaccinated person is deliberately exposed to the virus. But there are ethical issues with this. Also phase-3 studies are designed carefully by enrolling people from different age groups, races and socioeconomic backgrounds. Experts also say that it is difficult to predict which vaccine will be successful, as the vast majority in early development might fail. So, it's better to bet on several potential vaccines than on one vaccine. Why India needs to be cautious India is one of the 20 countries  that has expressed interest to be part of Sputnik V’s Phase-3 clinical trials. In addition, the Russian Direct Investment Fund has stated that it is planning to start mass production in other countries, including India, in partnership with local sovereign wealth funds. Russian President Vladmir Putin took a big gamble by going ahead with the vaccine. It would be tempting for countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico and others to follow Russia, as they struggle to contain the virus. A safe and effective vaccine is believed to be the quickest and surest way to achieve herd immunity. ",companies,"Last Updated : Aug 12, 2020 06:13 PM IST    | Source: ",Moneycontrol

In the first meeting held on July 21, 16 firms had attended the meeting. According to sources, the companies raised queries about flexibility in clusters, eligibility criteria, bidding process, procurement of trains, fares and maintenance. The Railways said it has reduced the Request For Qualification (RFQ) fee by one tenth for those entities participating in more than one project. The Railways told the participating companies that complete freedom will be given for procurement of trains. The Railways has also removed restriction of up to three projects per bidder and clarified that leasing of trains is allowed. The national transporter had earlier said the operator shall have the freedom to decide on fare to be charged from passengers. The indicative haulage charges have been fixed at Rs 512.31 per train km for 2019-20 with indexation. The responses to queries of the companies in the second pre-application conference will be uploaded by August 21. In the first pre-bid meeting too, the interested parties had raised queries ranging from the operation of trains to mode of financing. The due date for submitting RFQ is September 8, 2020. The private trains project of the Indian Railways is expected to boost the revenues of the national transporter, which has been trying to look at ways to reduce losses in that segment.
