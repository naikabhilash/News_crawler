https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/tata-motors-and-mahindra-in-see-saw-battle-in-key-auto-segments-5679121.html,Tata Motors and Mahindra in see-saw battle in key auto segments,"Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have locked horns for supremacy in not just the car and SUV segment but the commercial vehicle segment as well. In July, the two Mumbai-based companies lost their long-held positions to each other, actual vehicle registration data provided by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) show. Passenger vehicle segment Tata Motors displaced M&M in the passenger vehicle (car, SUV and van) segment to grab the third spot, behind Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. M&M was pushed down to the fourth spot. Tata Motors saw 12,753 registrations for its PVs in July, resulting in a market share of 8.10 percent (6.07 percent in July 2019). In comparison, M&M saw 7,811 registrations and a share of 4.96 percent in July (8.47 percent in July 2019). Deliveries of the new model, Altroz, and the restyled range of Bharat Stage VI models such as Nexon and Tiago pushed volumes for Tata Motors. Speaking to analysts, Shailesh Chandra, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, said: “Production could only restart in a proper manner in June. And post that, we have steeply ramped up in July to service very strong demand”. M&M officials blamed a fire at one of its headlamp and tail-lamp suppliers for crippling production of some models, including the Marazzo and XUV300. Speaking to analysts Rajesh Jejurikar, M&M’s Additional Director & Executive Director,  Automotive and Farm Sectors, said: “We had to start prioritising models after the lockdown. Given the strong rural pull we had started prioritizing the Scorpio and Bolero. So some of our models haven't even got out yet — that's all pent-up (demand) and for Marazzo, XUV 300 and XUV 500.” Commercial vehicle segment But the commercial vehicle (CV) space paints a completely different picture. Mahindra snatched the top spot from Tata Motors in the CV segment in July, perhaps for the first time ever, according to FADA data. Tata Motors was the unchallenged leader in the CV segment for several years, mirroring the success of Maruti Suzuki’s dominance in the PV segment. M&M’s market share jumped to 46.29 percent in July (24.75 percent in July 2019) with registrations of 8,930 units. Tata Motors’ market share during the same month nearly halved to 21.03 percent (40.11 percent in July 2019) with registration of 4,058 units. With Mahindra claiming the top spot and Tata Motors pushed down to the second, Ashok Leyland continues in the third spot. “There is an overall increase in rural demand and that is leading to movement of goods and agriculture. So we are seeing a very positive demand for pickups. Small commercial vehicle (SCV) demand is picking up because of the need for last-mile mobility. There is a lot of demand for SCV ambulances and we are struggling to ramp up to requirements,” Jejurikar added. The commercial vehicle category has been even more severely hit than the passenger vehicle segment because of slow national economic momentum. Smaller CVs, which cater to last-mile distribution, are gathering speed but the larger, medium and heavy (M&HCV) truck and bus segment are yet to come out of the woods. “One sees higher demand for last-mile distribution, which is addressed by small commercial vehicles. In terms of demand contraction, it is maximum in medium and heavy commercial trucks as well as buses,” Girish Wagh, President, Commercial Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors, told analysts.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/pv-business-to-get-cash-positive-by-fy23-tata-motors-to-retain-control-5628921.html,‘PV business to get cash positive by FY23’: Tata Motors to retain control,"Tata Motors  will retain control of the troubled passenger vehicle (PV) business unit even after finding a partner to jointly run the operations. The hiving off of the PV business will not reduce Tata Motors’ control over the business, a top company official said. The company has kick-started the process of hiving off the PV and electric vehicle (EV) business and placing it as a subsidiary, a process which could take a year to complete. Tata Motors has started talks with potential partners but has refused to share further details. Responding to a question from Moneycontrol, P B Balaji, Chief Financial Officer - Tata Motors said, “This (PV) is a business that we would want to run. We believe there is a long term potential in the business. The need for a partner is more from the point of view of accelerating the technology adoption and accelerating the product introduction roadmap. This is our business to run.” In March, the board of Tata Motors in-principle approved to hive off the PV business (including EV) by transferring relevant assets, intellectual properties and employees directly relatable to the PV business for it to be fully functional on a standalone basis through a slump sale. Though the spread of COVID-19 may have thrown a spanner in the works for Tata Motors, it is confident of completing the subsidiarisation process in less than a year. ""The board has approved the scheme for subsidiarisation and it will be filed with the NCLT in the coming weeks. We are expecting anywhere between 9-12 months for completing this process so it is a key priority for us in the coming months. We speak to a lot of OEMs and as and when we have something to share on that we will do it,” added Balaji. A move towards subsidiarisation of the PV business is the first step in securing strategic alliances that provides access to products, architectures, powertrains, new age technologies and capital. In simple terms this will unlock value for the company for the PV business unit which has been struggling in the face of strong competition. “The PV business will turn cash positive by FY23 and that will happen even without a partner that is the internal target we are working towards and we are confident of achieving that. Partnerships get us the momentum but that is not the base case,” added Balaji. ",,Moneycontrol,2020-08-01

In the three months until June 30, Britain's luxury carmaker said the UK market was particularly impacted by the pandemic with sales down 69.5 percent. However, it said that sales improved month-by-month within the quarter across all regions as economies re-opened, with June retails down 24.9 percent, highlighting a recovery in China and North America as “particularly encouraging”. “Jaguar Land Rover has reacted with resilience and agility to the extraordinary challenges faced in the first three months of the new fiscal year, adapting rapidly to the widespread macro-economic disruption and uncertainty facing our industry,” said Dr Ralf Speth, the outgoing CEO of JLR. “Through this unprecedented time, we have continued to bring outstanding new vehicles to market, electrifying our multi-award-winning range and building demand for the new Land Rover Defender, an icon reimagined for the digital age,"" he said. ""As the lockdowns ease, we will emerge from the pandemic with our most advanced product line-up yet, and with the financial and operating measures in place to return to long-term sustainable profit,” he said. The company said that about 98 percent of its retailers worldwide are now fully or partially open and all JLR plants have resumed production, with the exception of the Castle Bromwich facility in the West Midlands region of England, which will gradually restart from August 10. “All locations are operating with robust protocols and guidelines to ensure effective social distancing, hygiene and health monitoring, whilst still enabling production to increase in line with recovering demand,” JLR said. For the first three months of the 2020-21 fiscal year, revenue was 2.9 billion pounds in the quarter. The Chery Jaguar Land Rover Joint Venture in China achieved break-even profits in the quarter. Free cash flow was negative 1.5 billion pounds including a one-time working capital outflow of 1.1 billion pounds resulting from the plant shutdowns, which is about 500 million pounds better than previous guidance, the company said. It added that despite the significant impact of COVID-19, the company successfully completed 647 million pounds of new funding and ended the quarter with “solid liquidity” of 4.7 billion pounds, including 2.75 billion pounds of cash and short-term investments and a 1.9 billion pounds undrawn revolving credit facility. “The fundamental strengths of Jaguar Land Rover have been tested in 2020 and we will pass this test to succeed in the future. Our exciting pipeline of new, advanced products places us at the forefront of our industry,” added Speth, who will be succeeded by Thierry Bolloré as CEO next month. “We have a clear plan, a highly-skilled, creative team and unparalleled technical capabilities. I look forward to working with my successor Thierry Bolloré as Jaguar Land Rover focuses on its Destination Zero mission, and seeks to deliver the autonomous, connected, electric and shared experiences that our customers will love, for life with integrity,” said Speth, who will assume the role of non-executive vice-chairman of JLR. The carmaker part of the Tata Group said that sales of its New Land Rover Defender have started to ramp up in the quarter in the UK, Europe, North America, and some overseas markets, with sales beginning in China and other markets from July onwards. Plug-in hybrid and the recently-announced Hard Top commercial derivatives will be available later in the year. ",,Moneycontrol,2020-08-01

Addressing shareholders in the 75 th  annual report, Chandrasekaran said, “As we look ahead over the next two years, we anticipate a tremendous deal of transformation stemming from COVID-19. Consumer behaviour will change in numerous ways, from demanding more integrated digital experiences to prioritising health and safety features across purchasing decisions.” Though an expensive alternative to public transport, personal mobility will become a more accepted way of travel in the future. This is already seen through an uptick in demand for small hatchbacks during June and July as reported by the country’s largest carmaker  Maruti Suzuki . “The move to ‘slow’ travel and personal (versus public and/or shared) transport may shape future demand for passenger vehicles. Greater scrutiny will be placed on building environmental sustainability and climate resilience into the very core of business models,” Chandrasekaran added. Tata Motors is pushing through a strategic plan that will see the passenger vehicle business including electric vehicle division placed under a separate entity. The company is trying to bring in a partner who can assist in getting future ready but has declined to cede control of the division. “The global auto industry has grappled with multiple issues during the year. On one hand, we saw greater clarity emerge on Brexit; yet on the other hand, mounting trade tensions, muted global growth and enhanced regulatory norms have fundamentally changed the contours of the business environment,” Chandrasekaran observed. The Indian auto industry faced an unprecedented year, marked by significant headwinds. Domestic auto sales declined by 18 percent in FY20, the lowest since the data series was introduced in 2001. Alongside a broad economic slowdown, regulatory changes—including changed axle load norms and the migration to BSVI emission standards—fuelled uncertainty for both consumers and suppliers.

According to the company, Butschek’s total remuneration for FY20 was Rs 19.27 crore. The Companies Act 2013 prescribes a certain limit for executive payment if a company has ‘inadequate profits’. Tata Motors suffered a loss of nearly Rs 7,500 crore (Rs 7,083 crore as per Section 198 of the Companies Act) in FY20. The excess of Rs 11.82 crore is what Tata Motors wants to ratify through a special resolution. “Pursuant to the provisions of Section 197, in respect of the payment of managerial remuneration in case of no profits or inadequacy of profits, the company may pay such remuneration over the ceiling limit, provided the members’ approval by way of a special resolution has been taken for payment of the minimum remuneration for a period not exceeding three years,” Tata Motors said in the FY19-20 annual report. The special resolution that Tata Motors is proposing also seeks to hike Butschek’s salary for FY21. Will shareholders’ approval be easy? For Tata Motors, history offers little solace. In 2014, shareholders had turned down the company’s pay plan for three of its senior executives. The company failed to secure the required 75 percent votes in a postal ballot to compensate the then Executive Director (Commercial Vehicles) Ravindra Pisharody, Executive Director (Quality) Satish Borwankar, and the legal heir of former Managing Director Karl Slym in excess of the limits for the year that ended in March 2014. Even in Butschek’s case, this is not the first time that the company is seeking such an approval. Tata Motors had sought a similar approval and won it at the time of his appointment in 2016 for three years. With that period ending, the company is forced to approach the shareholders again. Accodring to Shriram Subramaniam, Founder & MD, InGovern, India’s first proxy advisory firm, in 2014, there was a loss in Tata Motors India, but, as a group, the company was profitable. The Companies Act states that any Indian company that is making losses needs to seek shareholders' approval for remuneration of EDs. Hence, even this year, they have placed such a proposal, he said. Butschek’s performance and salary Barring FY19, Tata Motors posted a net loss each year since Butschek assumed office in February 2016. In fact, an auto analyst, who did not want to be named, said his report card on Butschek is “not good”. “The company had just one profitable year, it has not been able to shrug off non-core investments, it missed an opportunity to tie up with global majors, and did not fully recover from the losses in the M&HCV market share,” he explained. “Successes with products like Tiago helped, but no traction was seen with Harrier. I have seen no effect as raw material cost to sales in the standalone entity is up each year from FY16 to FY 20 -- from 67.9 percent to 74.2 percent,” he said. “Payment of remuneration to Butschek from February 15, 2016, to March 31, 2019, was well within the statutory limits approved by the members,” Tata Motors said in its annual report. The payment of minimum remuneration would require fresh members’ approval in the event of inadequacy of profits in the 4th and 5th year of Butschek’s tenure -- from February 15, 2019, to February 14, 2021. Considering that the company had adequate profits for FY19, the said members’ approval is required for the period April 1, 2019 to February 14, 2021,” Tata Motors further explained. “As per the company’s budget/ business plan for FY20 approved by the board in March 2019, the company was expected to have adequate profits for FY20 and therefore no resolution was passed in the previous AGM held in 2019,” Tata Motors stated. For FY21, Tata Motors wants to give Butschek a pay hike of 20 percent to Rs 23.11 crore (subject to achievement of targets). This will be his fifth and final year as director of Tata Motors. In comparison, Mahindra & Mahindra MD Pawan Goenka received Rs 10.03 crore as salary for 2019-20, and Maruti Suzuki MD Kenichi Ayukawa Rs 5.02 crore for 2018-19. As COVID-19 hit all automakers hard, the profitability of Tata Motors was affected by about Rs 500 crore and free cash flows by about Rs 2,000 crore during FY20. Butschek and Tata Motors Butschek’s appointment at Tata Motors came after two years of intense global search under former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry following the death of previous MD Karl Slym. Butschek became the third foreigner to head Tata Motors (after Carl-Peter Foster and Slym). Before joining Tata Motors, he was the chief operating officer at Airbus, where he spent 30 months. Before that, he worked at Daimler AG for around 25 years, leading functions such as production, industrialisation and procurement. The last role he held in Daimler was that of president and chief executive of Beijing Benz Automotive Co, a joint venture between Daimler AG and Beijing Automotive Industrial Holding in Beijing, China.

  Indian IT firms are still winning fresh contracts and bringing in new business even as the volume and value of global IT contracts are shrinking.  
  The value and volume of global IT contracts fell by over 70% in the last three months compared to the same time last year. 
  Management at  TCS ,  Infosys  and others believe deals are only set to grow in the coming quarters, led by the demand for digital transformation as remote working becomes the norm. 
 
 Indian IT firms remain hopeful that the pace of new deals wins is only going to increase in the coming months. Yet GlobalData shows that new IT contracts are shrinking worldwide — both by value and volume. 
 
     
 Value and volume of IT services contracts shrink worldwide GlobalData 
 From $14.4 billion of global IT services spending at the end of June last year, this year companies only doled out $4 billion. Only 7% of the contracts signed in the last three months were valued above $100 million.

 However Indian IT firms are witnessing a different trend, with deal win numbers that are better than what they were in 2019. And, the management commentary paints a very different picture of new deal wins improving in the coming quarters.

 Indian IT companies buck the trend Analysts believe that the crunch in IT spending is due to pricing pressures. Most businesses are looking to conserve cash in the face of uncertainty. 
 
 Advertisement Indian IT companies — like  Tata Consultancy Services  (TCS), Wipro, Infosys,  HCL Technologies  and Tech Mahindra — believe that even though there was disruption, the current demand is driven by digital transformation. More businesses are looking to work from home bringing cloud adoption, automation, cybersecurity and consolidation to the forefront.
 
 The biggest IT company in India, TCS, saw a 22.5% dip in the value of new deal wins at the end of June as compared to three months ago, but when compared to the previous year — the value of its new deal wins was actually up by 21% at $6.9 billion.

 “Overall, from a first-quarter order book perspective, contrary to the fears of economic uncertainty and travel restrictions, etc., deal closures have continued at pace,” said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan during the earnings call.

 The other Indian IT services behemoth, Infosys, did see the value of its new deal wins come down by 35.5% year-on-year (YoY). However, the company already has the largest deal win in its history in the bag for a whopping $1.5 billion with Vanguard, which will be counted towards next quarter’s deal wins. 
     
 “As the challenges persist, we see clients looking for opportunities to improve the efficiency of their tech spend and we continue to see a robust pipeline of deals in this segment,” said Infosys’ COO Pravin Rao.

 “Looking ahead, I see very good growth in the pipeline. In the last quarter to this quarter, our pipeline increased by 40%,” said  HCL Tech  CEO C Vijayakumar. 
 
     All in all, the consensus by Indian IT services companies’ is that new deal wins are only set to grow in the coming quarters. The one concern they do have is that the closure of deals is taking longer than usual due to the current circumstances.

 The concession period of the project is 35 years, from the appointed date of July 5, 2012 including the initial construction period of five years.
 
 This is extendable for a further period of 25 years, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions by the SPV (special purpose vehicle) as set out in the concession agreement.
 
 The L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) said it has already submitted project cost overrun details to the state government for Rs 3,756 crore and ""has been pursuing the matter with the government for providing relief.""
 
 The original cost at the time of conception was Rs 16, 375 crore which has now crossed Rs 20,000 crore.
 
 Metro Rail operations in the city came to a standstill from March 22 due to the lockdown announced by the Centre to contain the spread of coronavirus.
 
 ""...However, the company is protected by the force majeure clauses of the Concession Agreement to claim extension of concession period equal in length to the period during which the Concessionaire was prevented from collection of Fare and reimbursement of force majeure costs. The management of the company will study the impact and will lodge appropriate claims within reasonable time once the operations are resumed,"" it said the annual report.
 
 Hyderabad and Mumbai are the only two cities in the country where Metro Rail is operated by private players under PPP (public-private partnership) mode and hence the resumption of operations is essential for the healthy survival of the concessionaire, an expert of the public transport said.
 
 The company's revenues from operations and other income for the 2019-20 stood at Rs 598.20 crore (including fare and non-fare revenue) as against Rs 318.46 crore for the previous financial year.
 
 The loss before tax and after tax were Rs 382.21 crore for the financial year under review as against loss before and after tax of Rs 147.32 crore and Rs 148.15 crore respectively for the previous financial year.
 
 The Concession Agreement includes construction of 71. 16 km of elevated metro rail corridor and rights for real estate development of 18.5 million sq.ft., with strategically located land parcels interspersed in prime city locations adjoining metro stations and metro corridors.
 
 During an interaction with netizens through Twitter, Telangana Minister KT Rama Rao on Sunday said ""We are waiting for the nod from Govt of India"" on the resumption of metro rail services in the city.""

Research and ratings provider ICRA has predicted volume shrinkage to 10 year lows in FY21 given the macro-economic headwinds compounded by the pandemic. “Demand headwinds are expected to continue over the near-term given the macroeconomic challenges in view of the pandemic outbreak, coupled with weakening financial profile of fleet operators and significant price hikes because of transition to BS-VI emission norms,"" said ICRA in its report on the CV industry.

 He said  Aashirvaad atta  has fortified its market standing across geographies and has reached over 3.6 crore households. Aashirvaad has achieved its highest ever volume share of 39.2% within the branded atta segment in June this year as per IMRB data.
 
 ITC, which has ambitions to become India's largest  FMCG  company, is betting heavily on the food business to achieve its goal and reduce dependence on the flagship cigarette business that has been under volume pressure due to recurrent increase in taxes. The food business last fiscal accounted for 80% of ITC's overall FMCG sales.
 
 The Sunfeast biscuit brand is ITC's second largest FMCG brand that clocked retail sales of Rs 4,000 crore and Bingo! snacks Rs 2,700 crore last fiscal. The Classmate stationary brand touched Rs 1,400 crore and YiPPee instant noodles nearly Rs 1,300 crore.
 
 ITC is market leader in branded atta, bridges segment of snacks, cream biscuit, notebooks and the second largest in overall snacks and potato chips segment, instant noodles, deodorant and agarbatti.
 
 However, the company's stationary products business took a beating in January to March quarter due to coronavirus lockdown which impacted overall FMCG business performance last year.

 Total-Adani Fuels Marketing Ltd  will apply for licences to offer the full bouquet of auto fuels at retail outlets, Adani Gas CEO  Suresh Manglani  said in first-quarter earnings call.
 
 Last year, Total had bought 37.4 per cent stake in billionaire Gautam Adani-promoted Adani Gas to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel market.
 
 ""Definitely we will take full benefit of the expertise and strength of Total,"" he said.
 
 Total-Adani Fuels Marketing Ltd, which is a subsidiary of Adani Gas , will offer natural gas, petrol, diesel, and electric vehicle charging facilities.
 
 He said the joint venture will seek licence under the liberalised fuel retailing regime announced by the government.
 
 Last year, the government allowed any entity with a net worth of Rs 250 crore to set up petrol pumps in the country.
 
 This replaced the earlier regime of only companies that have invested Rs 2,000 crore in either hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to be allowed to retail fuel in the country.
 
 Manglani said Total has got a second seat on Adani Gas board after the appointment of Jose Ignacio Sanz Saiz, who is vice-president for gas, renewables, and power in India and Country Chair of Total.
 
 ""Currently we are focusing on  CNG  development. But a separate company, Total-Adani Fuels Marketing Ltd will come into fuel retailing in the future. That plan is being developed. We will be offering multi-fuel to customers,"" he said.
 
 The Gautam Adani-led utility firm sells piped natural gas (PNG) to households and compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles and aims to diversify into retail sales of other fuels through this joint venture.
 
 Total, which in August 2018 exited a JV with Royal Dutch Shell in a 5 million tonne liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Hazira in Gujarat, had in October last year announced the acquisition of the stake in Adani Gas.
 
 This was followed by a 50:50 joint venture the two had agreed upon in October 2018 for two LNG import terminals of Adani on the east and west coast of India as well as for setting up of 1,500 petrol pumps in the country over 10 years.
 
 The French firm is the latest energy major seeking to expand its presence in India, which is the world's third-largest and the fastest-growing energy consumer. In August 2019, Reliance Industries said Saudi Arabian Oil Co is in talks to buy 20 per cent of its oil-to-chemical business at an enterprise value of USD 75 billion.
 
 State-owned oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) currently own most of the 69,924 petrol pumps in the country.
 
 Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy (formerly Essar Oil), and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with limited presence. Reliance, which operates the world's largest oil refining complex, has 1,400 outlets.
 
 Nayara has 5,756 pumps, while Shell has just 194.
 
 Currently, IOC is the market leader with 29,368 petrol pumps in the country, followed by HPCL with 16,707 outlets, and BPCL with 16,492 fuel stations.

In July, sales of MSI's mini segment cars comprising Alto and S-Presso grew by 49.1 per cent at 17,258 units as against 11,577 units in the same month last year but that of compact segment consisting of models like WagonR, Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire was down 10.4 per cent at 51,529 units as against 57,512 units in the year-ago month. The company's overall domestic passenger vehicle sales in July grew by 1.3 per cent at 97,768 units as compared to 96,478 units in July 2019. When asked if July sales data indicate recovery in the automobile market, Srivastava said, ""There is relief and optimism based on July numbers...It does indicate restoration of normalcy in terms of production, supply chain and that is the defining characteristic of July (sales)."" Srivastava, however, cautioned that the July numbers were over a low base of last year ""which is way off the high levels we have seen in the past"". ""Going forward we have to carefully watch. Long-term demand will depend on the fundamentals of the economy. Also, it will depend on which way this 'Covid sentiment' moves, that is a very uncertain thing. We have to also closely watch the local lockdown because it does disrupt the momentum of retails at both the dealer end as well as the consumer end,"" he said. The localised lockdowns have also had an impact on the functioning of the company's retail outlets, he added. ""We have 3,080 outlets, out of which at one point of time we had more than 2,800 functioning. Then local lockdown started and it keeps on varying because at different places sometime lockdown is for one week, sometimes for five days,"" he said, adding at present the total number of the company's outlets that are open is varying between 81-91 per cent of total outlets. On festive season outlook, he said, ""Since it is a discretionary purchase it will depend a lot on how sentiments are. In festival times car buying generally increases because consumers have a bigger intention or inclination to spend money but sentiment this time is little unprecedented."" ",,Moneycontrol,2020-08-02

Tech Mahindra CFO Manoj Bhat told Business Insider that this will mean a change in policies, facilities and even bring about a new model to attract talent.  He also explained the rationale behind deciding upon one-third workforce being moved to WFH.  Check out the latest news and updates at Business Insider. Even as companies grapple to align their business operations with the ‘new normal’ post this pandemic, many companies are already making remote work a permanent part of their day-to-day operations — and this list now includes Tech Mahindra.  Tech Mahindra CFO Manoj Bhat told Business Insider that at least 25% to 30% of the company’s employees will be permanently working from home even after the lockdown lifts. “This will mean change in policies, change in our facilities, creating a new model to attract talent — all of those changes will come in,” he said.     And, Tech Mahindra plans to hit that number within the next four quarters. “Maybe by March or June next year,” added Bhat.

He added that it will also be a mix of working from home and coming into the office for employees. “We have picked up that continuously working from home, there is an element of becoming distant and not connected,” he said.

  Tech Mahindra  will open up  lateral hiring , but only after it brings its utilisation levels back up to pre-COVID levels.  
  Tech Mahindra CFO  told Business Insider that the company does plan on bringing new people on board based on demand. 
  It also plans to reduce subcontractor costs by substituting them with its own employees. 
  Check out the latest news and updates on  Business Insider.  
 Most Indian IT companies have plans to open lateral hiring over the next three months, and so does Tech Mahindra, but not before it brings its utilisation levels back up. 
 
  
 Tech Mahindra's utilisation levels over the last five quarters Company filings/BI India 
 Between April to June, the company’s utilisation — which measures the performance of employees — was down by 1%. “The first focus would be to bring that up and make it back to our levels, where we were a couple of quarters back,” Tech Mahindra’s CFO Manoj Bhat told Business Insider in an interview.

 Advertisement Tech Mahindra isn’t the only company dealing with a utilisation problem. Infosys saw an even bigger dip of 2.3% in the last three months. Analysts believe that more offshoring of deals will help the numbers come back up in the coming quarters. 
 
     Once utilisation jumps back up, Tech Mahindra plans to open up the doors to lateral hiring. Much of it will demand and which sectors it’s coming from. “I don’t think we’ll be hiring in advance,” explained Bhat. 
 
 
 Employee substitution Aside from utilisation taking a hit, Tech Mahindra’s subcontracting costs were also higher between April to June. According to CFO Bhat, the sudden uptake is only due to the company’s latest acquisitions — Cerium and Zen3.
 
 Advertisement “In the longer run, subcontractor substitution by employees is what we’re thinking about,” said Bhat. 
 
 The company may not be using its employees most efficiently, but its attrition rate has continued to improve. It settled at around 17% in the first quarter, which is 2% lower than the previous quarter.
